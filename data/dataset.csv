" ""Chick Lit "" for ""Foodies"": What a great read = tips on cooking,lovemaking and Italian insults. Laughed and laughed. Thanks. Looking forward to film.",0
" ""Uh oh he's been using Brand X"": An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real ""fusion"" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?",0
" $25K warranty isn't included in packaging or at APC site: This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this ""$25,000"" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?",0
" *** BEWARE ***: This TV is set so that it is not capable of a ""recall"" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying.",0
" [Not what I expected]: ... My daughter and I loved the movie. She is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game. Absolutely no challenge, and very little interaction. It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed. There are no games to play, nothing to figure out, nothing to do. Save your money.",0
" 2/3 of a great book, then... blah: I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?",0
" 4 year old BORED with this after 2 weeks: I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it.",0
" 80's High Tech with Rock Emotion: Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the highlight of the 3 A&M projects. The song ""Curious Kind"" is simply a masterpiece!The remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!",0
 A Book That Is Worth a Second Look: This book is great. It is very informative. It is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures. i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about Chinese Medicine.,0
" A change from the Carpathian Series: The heroine, Nicoletta is the village healer. Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home, the Palazzio, is a foreboding place, mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the ""pounce on each other in the first chapter"" genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts.",0
" A complete waste: My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile.",0
" A Contemporary Fairytale Sure to Delight!: While this book is a take-off on the classic Snow White, it's a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and look forward to more of Ms. Sinclair's works.",0
" A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the ""New Young"" of Japan seem to be creating an ""international"" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!",0
" A FIVE STAR BOOK: I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!",0
" A good game to buy.: I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the ""frustration factor"", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a ""5"" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the ""easy"" and ""medium"" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd.",0
 A good product available in convenient range of sizes: This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other Dockers products. And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs.,0
" a great book for Historical romance lovers: This is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May. With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels.",0
" A long promo for the Thomas center(s): Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money.",0
" A museum exhibit inside a book: This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust.",0
" A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant Antoine's: If you've ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine's in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this book. And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called ""Madame Castel's Lodger,"" which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller",0
" A rare & wondeful treat: I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition...especially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders! Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video. (...)Overall great package, great mixes, great rarities.",0
" A really bad book: Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was written for about the 6th grade level.2 There was virtually no ""grab"" for the first 2/3 of the book. I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother. If you do, you'll be asking the same thing I did, ""I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this book.""Harris LevinCruel and Unusual: A Kay Scarpetta Novel",0
" A romantic zen baseball comedy: When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA"". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!",0
" A Taste of Italy: Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying.",0
" A very good how-to manual.: If you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures, this is not the one to buy.A lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to. This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project.",0
" ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance: I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon.",0
 Alaska sourdough: REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska. Loved it. I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon. Book is full of great stories and recipes.,0
" Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.",0
 Amazing: i have ordered this cd of here but it will take abit to get to me as i live in England. But i have danced and sang along to it at the arcades ive been to and i think its great if you love to dance. My favorite songs are what a feeling and in the navey!! i also like captain jack but i love them all..,0
" amazing: I Loved this book. Heart pounding romance and action, keep you going though the whole storie. I say this is a Must Read!",0
" an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^",0
" an extreme emotional ride: If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway).",0
" An interesting little essay: Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries.This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature. it starts out as a political tract, then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end. For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile.",0
" An old friend: This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948).",0
 An Old World change that's definitely wonderful: The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all.,0
" Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.",0
" Another one done!!!: Very very good!!....I can usually figure out who did it, not this time. so many complicated twists and turns. Great read!!!",0
 Ariel Litte Mermaid with pearl kit: Arrived very quickly and it is a cute topper however I wouldn't have bought it if they didn't provide instructions!!!! I should have listened to the other reviews.... If you are hoping to get more than the topper DO NOT BUY THIS!! So annoyed I have this Ariel and have no idea how to decorate the cake.,0
" Artistry: I think that the Deodato concerts are very rich, as he used real strings and band musicians, as well as you can appreciate the John Tropea excelent renditions on guitar.",0
" As Bad a Production as Possible: This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD.",0
" audio options non existent: While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock.",0
" autumn: got this for my daughter in NC, she is now making prefect bread. Wish she lived closer to make me some",0
 Awesome: This is probably the best essay I have ever read. It has defined my political reviews still today. It's a work of true romanticism.,0
" Awesume! BEST BLOCKS EVER!: THIS TOY WAS OUR GRANDSON'S FAVORITE, SO I JUST HAD TO FIND IT AGAIN FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDCHILD. THANK GOODNESS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING.",0
" Awful beyond belief!: I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!",0
" Back to basics: Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere.",0
" Bad Deal!!: I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future.",0
" Bad skating technique: I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this.",0
" Barbie as Rapunzel: A Creative Adventure: I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her.",0
" barbie rapunzel = crying child: My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers. But halfway through the game, the program hung, and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else. Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up, we are frozen in one spot while Barbie's disembodied voice urges us to ""explore somewhere else in the castle.""Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help. Vivendi Games' support site is ""currently disabled."" And now I'm left with a weeping, frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work. I'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around. Or maybe they just don't care about the problems, so long as you get our 20 bucks. If you don't want a crying little girl, avoid this game!",0
" Barbie's Boring Ice Show: I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game.",0
" Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$.",0
" Bass - voice delight in jazz music: Miss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass, the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group. As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player. This is the second, according to my knowledge, and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings. A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude.",0
" Beautiful Love Story: I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is ""This is a paranormal disaster area!""",0
 bench: The bench is very nice. I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched. I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic. wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on. the bench broke after sitting on it three times. The glider bar broke. the weld is not very good or sturdy.,0
" Best game ever: This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play.",0
" Better than some out there.: My one-year-old has played with this toy for several months. He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves. Not quite what I expected. He's had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again, and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make. The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises, also not quite what I expected. But it's noise I can deal with. The volume can be adjusted or turned off (through I myself can't distinguish between ""soft"" and ""loud"" on this thing). My son enjoys the toy, but it may be of limited or intermittent interest.",0
 BEWARE!!: Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....,0
" Book review: This is a book for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent, raising responsible children. It can also be used on co workers and the rest.",0
" Buyer Beware!!: I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!",0
" Buyer beware: This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",0
" Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!!: This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!",0
" bye bye mom and dad: My children and I love the little Critter books. This is a great book, but it was not bound well. The book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it.",0
" California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy: The California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy,is to spice up the relationship and it worked since the beginning,my other half likes it.",0
" Cameriere!: I enjoyed this book-- it was much better than the standard ""chick lit"" titles. It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to ""Roman young stud"" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno.I liked this book SO MUCH more than ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"" - it was a fun read.",0
" Cannot recommend: As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must.",0
 CASH MONEY AND NO LIMIT ARE THA SAME THANG!: THERE BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NO LIMITS BUT THERE FROM THA SAME PLACE AND THERE GHETTO HOOD IS VERY CLOSE.THEY RAP JUST LIKE NO LIMIT.BUT NO LIMIT WAS FIRST AND IT WILL BE THA LAST.NO LIMIT IS STILL NUMBER1 IN EVERY WAY.,0

" Charisma: What it is about ""Henry Dog"". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an ""incurable"" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a ""real"" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14"" and 3"". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle ""Henry Dog`s"" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive.",0
" classic: most underrated rap group, when lil wayne actually talked real s*** besides aliens and skateboards..if u like lil Wayne u should deffinetly love this album",0
" comfy,warm.. but run big: just like the title says. Warm, comfy but run a size too big. I don't wear them out as they are just for lounging, so it's not that big of a deal for me.",0
" Complete reference... yes: Well although i found the book to be extremely informative and I learned a great deal from it, I was very disapointed that I could not get a lot of the examples to work for me. I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed. I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details.",0
" Couldn't finish it: I really like Christine Feehan. This book was very dissapointing. The plot had promise. Nicoletta was a sweet heroine. The prose were good, and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace. However, the plot flows like molasses in January. I managed to get half way through before I through the book down and went back to the 'Dark' series.",0
" Creepy: Wow, what people will do behind jealousy and revenge - there are some doors you should not open, and if you do - be prepared for what you find behind it!",0
" Cruel and Unusual: A typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel, easy to read and a page turner. It gripped me until the end. Enjoy.",0
 Cruel and Unusual: Cruel and Unusual is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have got read and I for one loved it and I can't wait the read more of her books my boyfriend told me about Patricia Cornwell books he said I need to read Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross and those will be my next two book I will be reading and I will be reading them on my new IPad I got for Christmas I can't wait keep up the great writing Patricia and thanks to my boyfriend for telling me about this awesome writer.........RKsbabydoll,0
 Cruel and Unusual: The book was excellent. I was barely able to put it down. I love the Kay Scarpetta series and am excited when I get to read more.,0
" Cut smaller than usual: I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch.",0
" Cute gift for a little baby: Although I felt it looked a bit chinsy, the mother had it on her wish list and was very happy to receive them.",0
" Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal: This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service.",0
" Dark Horses a must have CD: I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon.",0
" DDR is cooool!: This cd is really great.BUT ITS NOT A GAME!they're not long versons though, only 90 odd seconds each.If that Claire, also from the UK (who was disappointed with the cd) wants to get in touch, i know where you can get games with the songs you want.I'm assuming you're after all the cool songs from euromix.If so, they are on 2nd and 3rd mix games from japan.but there are also US versions available too.",0
" Definitely enjoyed!: This was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter. She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer. She is still enjoying this game. She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first, but she loves to do it over and over again. The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant. It seems to be very user friendly also....my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time.",0
" Delicious and Addictive: This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores.",0
" Delicious cookie mix: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.",0
" Delicious reading: I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a ""trifle overdone"" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons.",0
" Did you like 400 degreez?: A continuation of the illest hip-hop album in recent times, 400 degreez. If you aren't down w/ C.M.B yet, go get 400 degreez first. If you already got and you love it, this is just another hour of banging bump and car music. Great",0
" Didn't live up to expectations.: I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better.",0
" Different: The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics. This essay doesn't do any of that. It goes into art, and even pseudo-psychology (one could say). It covers a broad variety of topics in a short amount of pages. I agree with almost everything said in this book. It's definitely worth reading and will really make you think.",0
" Dirty South: This is probably the best southside CD to ever come out. Pretty much every song has a guest or 2 on the track. From the late Fat Pat, to Botany Boys, Mr. 3-2, Big Steve, Chris Ward, H.A.W.K, and many more. This is how a southside CD should always be.",0
" Disappointed Romanian!: This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is ""clean and proper"" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are ""tourist guides"" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment.",0
" Disappointed: I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries.",0
 disappointed: i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again.,0
" Disappointing: The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume.",0
" Disturbing: Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher.",0
" DO NOT BUY, A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!: My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money.",0
" Do not waste your time....lousy: This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.",0
" Dockers do the job.: This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product.",0
 Does not work!: It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.,0
" Doesn't Fit: I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!",0
" Doesn't work on a Mac: It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!",0
" Don't Be Fooled!: I bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs. Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists! In fact, it says various artists, which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs. It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is, after all, a compilation of music by various artists! Duh! So, don't waste your money. I will probably throw these in the trash as I'm a purist and I want original, not wedding reception music!",0
" Don't bother: The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new.",0
" Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous: What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon.",0
" Dont run out to get Outrun unless your from 1985: Outrun was the biggest disappointment of my holidays.If you've just come home from a life in 1985 you might enjoy this. I read the reviews before buying but it didn't sink in what Arcade style meant. I am an addicted follower of Colin MacRea rally and thought to race a ferrari across the US would be cool. I was wrong. The games is to car racing what space invaders is to ""Battlefield"". The landscape moves instead of the car and you have these idiotic stages like impress your girlfriend with how many slides you can do. Total rubbish. Not anyones fault but mine, but I live in Ireland and got it shipped through Florida so it is a costly mistake.",0
" Don't Trust the Images: Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. ""Cafe,"" for example, should be ""Coffee."" Despite the fact that the image for ""Cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""Cafe"" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got.",0
" Don't try to fool us with fake reviews.: It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?",0
" Don't waste your money: I ordered this because my apartment doesn't have a light switch in the living room. It worked fine for about a week, then occassionaly would take 3 or 4 clicks to get the light to turn out. Now it will work 1 out of maybe 100 attempts, and only within 6 feet of the outlet. Terrible",0
 easy and fun for 3-4yr olds: fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing. I've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue. It's a shame my 4yr old really likes it.,0
" Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.: Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.1 Star because they sent 6 feet of 2"" OD copper pipe.0 Star because they won't accept returns on it.5 stars because I figure it's actually worth $12-15/foot and since they won't take a return I figure I can sell it and make $40-50 on this deal",0
" ESTE LIBRO CONTIENE TODO: LO QUE PENSE QUE NO ME INTERESABA SABER SOBRE EL BOX Y SUS CAMPEONES...PERO ME CAUTIVO Y LO LEI HASTA EL FINAL !AHORA SI PUEDO DISCUTIR DE BOX CON MI ESPOSO Y MIS CUADOS...Y HASTA CON MI SUEGRO, QUE ES EX BOXEADOR !",0
" Even Mommy has fun with this one!: My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie. This game is tons of fun, even for a 42 year old. We love playing it together. We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems. What even better is, she can play it alone and I get some me time!",0
" Excellent - Very Useful: I find this book highly useful as a desktop reference for just about anything HTML/DHTML related. In addition, Powell does a great job of introducing topics that may be new to some people, like XML.",0
" Excellent book, very poor e-book editing: Yet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by e-book publishers.Multiple spelling errors, improperly placed figures & captions, whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reason.If you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing, look no further, but please pick up the print version instead of the e-book.",0
" Excellent product: These Alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items. I have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more,",0
" Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross",0
" Extremely Disappointed with this video: I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.",0
" Fabulous...: This book was awesome. A fast paced, riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers, Feehan fan or not. But be warned, by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan.",0
" False Advertisement: The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied.",0
" False advertising: If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants.",0
" Fantastic Advanced Course!: Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced.",0
" Fantastic Book: This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children.",0
" Fantastic glider/ bench: Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio.",0
" Fashionable Compression Stockings!: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling.",0
" Fast mp3 download of music waxed decades ago: One of these 26 songs played as background music on a YouTube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of Russia. I hunted down the melody, read the English lyrics, then decided to see what else was in the album. Downloaded the full album for $15 via Amazon mp3 downloader, and now happily listen to the melodies (interspersed) on my iPod.",0
" Feels like a commercial...: All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*",0
" Fire Truck Puzzle: The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. It is very colorful and well worth the price. The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it. But I am very pleased with the quality.",0
" Food porn, and I mean that in the best possible way: I didn't like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn't make me think, but, oh I didn't notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. During, I read and read, bathing in the glorious food descriptions, not to mention the allure of Italy. Oh Yes!",0
" formula type writing: My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite.",0
" From The Label:: From Memphis, TN. comes The Reatards, fronted, of course, by wild kid Jay Reatard. He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the tender age of 15. Jay, now 19, is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community. Overdriven, loud, crackling guitars underlaying Jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years.",0
" Fun To Listen To.: This is the second best Cash Money album I've ever heard next to Juvenile's 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too. The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 ""I Need A Hot Girl"", ""We On Fire"", ""Respect My Mind"" & ""Tuesday & Thursday"". Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? ""Ridin'"" is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like ""Clear Tha Set"" by Lil'Wayne. ""Ya Dig"" by Juvenile. ""Help"" by B.G., and ""Bout Whatever"" by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. ""Too Hot"" is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk & Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!",0
 Fun toy!: My 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it. He loves to watch the animals pop up and make noises. It's fun to watch his face light up and hear him squeel with delight when he hits one of the buttons and the animal pops up.,0
 Gardening lawn book: Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again.,0
" Gauges in chair arms: Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product. Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised. I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them.",0
" ghetto foolishness: i like the Hot Boys and really like Juvenile, but this is not good. the only thing good is ""we on fire"" and ""I need a hot girl"". just download those 2 songs onto your Ipod and skip this album.",0
" glider: the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice",0
" Glorious story: I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story.",0
" God's Zoo: Wonderful video, very comical and loved by kids, also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs.",0
" Good book: Well written chronicles of The Farm from the people who lived it. Excellent photos as well.I kept looking for a photo of me and my then-wife, but I wasn't there long enough. But shewas :-)",0
 Good but received defective book: I bought this book because we are moving to Germany and I wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in Europe that we could travel too. Unfortunately pages 457-480 on Greece are not in English - looks to be Spanish. There was some sort of printing problem! But I found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries.,0
" Good Deal and Fast Shipping: I bought this book used and it was in very good condition. Also, I received it within a week, which was nice.",0
" Good for a laugh: I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up.",0
" Good place to start Web development: It is a great book for all new arrivals to the Web development and design world. The book's title doesn't indicate the real content, it is not just HTML, it is an introduction to web design covering HTML, JavaScript, Client-Programming, Server-Programming, CSS, XML, and many other topics. I recommend it to all beginners but wishing to become experts.",0
" Good songs, bad cover.: This CD compilation set was purchased for me. I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they're poorly covered by ""the Starlite Singers"".",0
 Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times!: Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again,0
" Great Actors - Well done film!: Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the ""in-laws"" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live ""Happily Ever After"". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage.",0
" Great Blocks: My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends.",0
" Great book: This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night.",0
 Great combination of creativity and adventure: My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!,0
" Great control racquet: A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made.",0
" Great for the money: The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available.",0
" Great for Twins: I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. They are just over 8 months old and they love them. This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! I would recommend this to anyone, plus I love Fisher Price.",0
" Great Game: My daughter, almost 7, loves this game. She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day. We did have to upgrade our system, but the game hasn't crashed since and hasn't been slow. Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels. (The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them.) This game has even seemed to help my daughter's actual skating - she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went.",0
 great gift: my brother in law was thrilled with the clarity and instructional commentswill be looking for more titles by her,0
" Great Glider: We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!",0
 Great Graphics!: 2006 Coast to Coast for PC is great! The graphics are awesome... The game is what I had hoped for and a lot more!!,0
" Great little surge protector: Great value for a surge protector. I've got 'em on lots of electronics (printers, phones, laptops) that don't need a full power strip or universal power supply (UPS). Very portable for laptops, in case you're travelling.",0
" Great movie, not so great DVD: This is one of my favorite bollywood movies. If you're a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you'll love this movie. It's interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story. Where a lot of movies consist of ""boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy and girl get married"" this movies looks at the question of ""then what?"" I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half, but I didn't think it was that excessive. The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face.I'd give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better.",0
" Great Read: I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle.",0
" Great Reading: Christine Feehan does it again, for all of you that have only read this one book by her, i strongly suggest that you read them all!",0
" Great resource for Chinese/Eastern medincine: This is an excellent book to have as a reference fo eastern methodologies in medicine and healing. Unfortunately it is long out of print, but if you can get your hands on a copy of this text, you will not be dissappointed. In fact, if you are unhappy with it, I will be happy to purchase it from you as I have many peers that would happily use it.",0
" Great travel guide to Europe!: This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect. You get a good overall view for the most important sights, places, cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information. As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!",0
 Great value.: This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format. I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus. Definitely worth every penny.,0
 Great: Well paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists. Patricia Cornwell writes characters that are real and have depth. Her mastery of criminal science is wonderful and offers a sense of authenticity that few authors achieve.,0
" Grrrrr. Arrrrgh.: We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling.",0
" Guitar in Absentia: With all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts, I was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album. Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen. However, I am dissapointed in the direction Steve has taken his music.",0
 Hanford Mills museum: My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy.,0
" happy with it...but: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!",0
 haven't found better yet...: This is the only product that can manage my hair without making it stiff or sticky.,0
 Henry has come home...: I had Henry back in the early 70's. I am forty now and still have my original. I bought a new one for my Dad who is ill because I knew he would get the significance. Henry got me through the insecurities I had as a child and I am hoping he does the same for my Dad as he battles terminal cancer.Thanks for making him again.,0
" Homer or Moses?: An extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use. For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures, this book is essential. Is it complex and detailed? Of course, it must be to argue the point. Should you buy it? Yes, unless you want to keep running back to the library. I write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above.",0
" Hours of Fun for my 4 and 6 year olds: We purchased this game a year ago and my girls still love to play it. Lot's of activities, they love to decorate the floats and watch the parade.",0
" Hunting the Hard Way: Thia was a gift for my Husband, who loved the book. It arrived on the date we were told it would.",0
" I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't...: I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol.com""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't touch Cash $ Money Records. I don't know why that new Tru CD sold one million in the first place. Who cares, 'cause I just checked the billboard charts and discovered that Juvenile sold more that two million. So they can't be faded. Anyway, back to this CD. Every song on this CD rocks. My favorite song is ""Help"" by B.G. I love this CD.",0
" I found it! Henry Dog!: I had two Henry Dogs. One I lost in a ride at Walt Disney World, the second to replace it. I have no idea where Henry got to. But now that I found ""him"", I will have my friend again. I had this toy from the time I was six years old, almost 40 years ago, and I think I'll be seeing him again around Christmas time. It's a sweeet toy and really good for children of *all* ages!",0
" I give it 5 stars because it's entombed: I have waited nearly four months for this album and the wait is finally over, it's a good little album, show casing the many talents of this great metal band. It's not left hand path or wolverine blues material (both albums are in a league of their own, respectively) but for a moment just try to forget about the past work of entombed and listen to this like u are listening to them for the first time, I know that it is hard though. I recommend for the metal maniacs, entombed's new album, ""uprising"". I have owned it for about 2 weeks and it gets better with each listen, one for the collection. Entombed are the greatest band in the whole world...Cheers!",0
" I got fooled...: I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!",0

" I guess it was a mystery: In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia.",0
" I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nights...: This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!",0
" i liked this album more then i thought i would: I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days.",0
" I really wish i hadn't wasted my time: First, let me say, I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now.",0
" Ick ack. Put it back.: I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, ""leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to"". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier.",0
 If it ain't broke don't fix it: I have been using this product for 5+ years. It was wonderful. About 1 year ago the company changed packaging and the product changed slightly. The bottle is taller now and something is missing from the serum. Doesn't work as well as it used to work. I will not be purchasing this item because of the change.,0
" Incorrect disc!: I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message.",0
" Inproper Advertising: I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book: Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell. The one I ordered from Amazon was listed as a CD set (not as a cassette set) so I ordered it. I received a Cassette set of the book and NOT a CD set of the book. I wrote (through Amazon) to the seller and their reply was that I received a CD set.The Librarians can vouch for what I received as I showed them the envelope and the contents within it. Even though it was my responsibility to replace the CD book (so I wouldn't have to pay the Library charge), I now had to give that job to the library. Need I say more?This time, and it's the first time, Amazon has a very disgruntled customer.Thanks for asking for the review. Maybe Amazon could check into this and prevent others from experiencing what I experienced.Sincerely,Sherry BohmP.S. Yes, my husband and I are still Amazon shoppers. We're just going to have to be more careful now.",0
" Intriguing story: While I don't consider it the best of Ms. Feehan's books that I have read, The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid. The protaganists are believable and interesting. If you like Ms. Feehan's books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library.",0

" Is this great TV??? You bet it is: Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie ""Glitter"" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC.",0
 It Drew Air: This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.,0
" It was ""ok"" but I won't watch it again: I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen.",0
" It's a knock off.: The official Chrono Trigger OST has 3 discs. This version has some of the major tracks on it, the audio quality is good, but Caveat Emptor (buyer beware) this is a Chinese knock-off.Oh and if you buy the 3 disc version, make sure the cover does not have a green and red logo reading ""FX"", for this is also a counterfeit. The serial numbers on the real soundtrack CDs are PSCN-5021, PSCN-5022, and PSCN-5023.",0
" IT'S GREAT!: All the other reviews say this product is boring and ""save your money""....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater ""never falls""?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!",0
" James Moody takes San Diego ""Beyond the Border""!: James Moody, and his well known ""cast of characters"" have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done... I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own. I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someone...and it never fails to do the job. There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it. They know that song, but they've ""never heard it played like THAT before"".",0
" Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High: Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help.",0
" Just a few.: These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!",0
" Just as trashy as garbage music comes...: I listen to every kind of music in existence, and I always give everything a chance. But now I'm permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They're CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They're millionaires because they repeat the words ""huh,"" ""what,"" and ""yeah"" for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They're millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what ""so-called"" hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it's worth your money cause I ain't gonna spend a penny on it.",0
" Just Plain Cruel Will Do: I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book.",0
" Just so-so: This is a DVD with footage of a ""Come Out and Meet Thomas"" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the ""party/interview"" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either.",0
" keeps his attention: My little boy is just getting interested in these blocks. They are too cute! He's learning to manipulate the block in his hands. The little things inside the blocks are adorable. Some spin, some twirl, some rock. A definate upgrade from the standard wooden blocks.",0
 Keeps me healthy and I am not allergic to this brand.: I like the Solaray Brand. I am not allergic to it. Vitamin D-3 was recommended by my doctor. The Vitamin D-3 keeps me healthy.,0
" Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!: My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the ""Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!"" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, ""train"" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse.",0
" Kitchen TV: I bought this to replace a 13"" tube tv in my kitchen. What I gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space. The picture is good, and the internal DVD player is a bonus. All in all, a good purchase.",0
" Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....: Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA.",0
 letters from home: i like letters from home cuz it tells a story that if you really listen you can acctually hear john michael montgomery tell his story of soldiers and all that stuffi liked it and i like punk rock and rock so it must be good if i like it,0
" Little one, maid of Israel: Bill Harvey has a wonderful gift of making history come alive in this book. This book awakens a sense of wonder at the possiblility of a real relationship with God as you follow the faithfulness of one little girl in ancient times. Young girls ages 5-15 will love this book. It has always been one of my most loved treasures, a real Keeper !",0
 Loads of fun!: My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner!,0
" LOVE IT!: I just got this from a local Stop and Shop and LOVE it! It leaves my hair so soft, smelling good and you can't even tell that I have any product in my hair. I'm reading a lot of reviews where people are saying that they can't find it anywhere. Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!",0
 Love Scarpetta: You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell. This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor.,0
" Loved it! (P.S. Stephen Colletti is so hot!): I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!",0
" Low resolution and poor quality: I bought it new in 2002 for $400. The color is pretty good. The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes. I didn't use it a lot for the first 3 years, only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time. Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now. I don't know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter's piano class.",0
" Ludicrous and silly: I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly.",0
" Makes for fascinating reading.: Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch",0
" Makes you not want to sleep at night.....: This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!",0
" mask maker: I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert.",0
 mask maker: It was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming,0
" MASK OF FAMILIARITY: MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need.",0
" Maybe I got a bad one.: My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it.",0
" mens ultrasheer: This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!",0
" Mind numbing: This game makes you do the same things over and over, it never holds my son's attention long enough to get to the next level. There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order. We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it, but this one is a dog!",0
" Molly Myers: Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme.",0
" More great playing: Larry's work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing. Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control. Listen to Larry's take on ""My Funny Valentine"" and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with Chet Baker's or Miles'. A very fine album that you'll enjoy again and again.",0
" MORE THAN LETTERS...: I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN",0
" More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much: I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections.",0
" mostly, but occasionally they use ....",0
" Muddled ending disapoints: The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw.",0
" My Daughter Hates It: I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow.",0
" My Henry: I had Henry back in the 70's. I don't remember him with a nose since it was chewed off, but he was well loved. He's long gone and I thought I was the only one who ever had a Henry since nobody knew what I was talking about. I can't believe I've found him again!! Nobody can replace my original worn Henry, but I'm so excited to have his clone back!!",0
" My Son finds it annoying: My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.",0

" Never gets going: This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written.",0
" New Wave 80s: I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it.",0
" Nice for the money: The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.",0
 nifty: It is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way. Works well too.,0
 no good: I gave it 5 stars because my little dog had so much fun riping it apart but only took him 24 hrs to do it buy that is 23 hrs longer than other balls,0
" No instructions included - do not trust seller: Promised with this item are ""Complete Instructions"" and the additional pledge that ""Sweet Graces will email you with the Supply List and Instruction sheets on purchase - so you can be ready ahead of time!"" I received none of this - only a plastic figurine and bracelet. To boot, Amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller. All I got was a phone number for the manufacturer. Let's hope that yields some results. Meanwhile, I'm wishing I had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller :/",0
 no technical information: this book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building,0
" NO, NOT 5 STARZ 6 STARZ!: this album hea is just ""too hot"". this album is tha first album that really made me like all the songs. cash money is my favorite rap label and i like other labels too but it don't get no realer than this right cha'. this album is just to real, i mean, every song on it just blow up. every single day when i come home from school, i just have to stop and take some time out and listen to Hot Boys ""Guerilla Warfare"". like i said in the beginning ""not 5 starz 6 starz"", if you know what i mean!",0
" NOT A RIDE ON: I should have paid closer attention to the size of this horse when I ordered it, but it should not be in the ride-on section. It is clearly not a ride on toy. It is tiny. The beanie babies ride on this horse and fit perfect. All it is is a stuffed horse on wheels and it is so tiny. My kids never play with it. This was a learning lesson for me with shopping online.",0
" Not her best...........: Before I begin, let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential, but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards.",0
" Not Like the Old Formula: The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review.",0
" NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC: NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work.",0
" Not Patterns - but Detailed Sketches: Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book.",0
" Not professional quality: I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others.",0
" Not really what I wanted: For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called ""Perfect Gentleman"" with 2 titles on it: ""Ooh la la"" and ""One more Chance"". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy.",0
" Not so good - ok for a rental!: This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money.",0
" Not the best in the series: Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one.",0
" Not the best: I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills.",0
" Not the best: I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!",0
 NOT the worst American B-Movie: This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!,0
 Not up to scratch!: I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.,0
" Not very good....: I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?",0
" Nothing you don't already know: If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!",0
" Now, The Rest of the Story: I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!",0
" Oh dear: I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen",0
" Oh please: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.",0
" Oh where Oh where have my Oh's gone?: I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that ""the site who has everything including a church"" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small. I get maybe 3 bowls out of the entire box:-(.",0
" Oh!: This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!",0
" Old and good: This book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but Ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in Alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen, just a pot of sourdough.",0

 One of a kind book for timber frame building.: My husband loves this book. He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by.,0
" One of the best!: If you are looking for something that entertains, tells a great story, and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone (or with the food) this is the perfect book. I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy. All who have read it, especially women, love it.",0
" Outstanding guidebook for building your own timberframe home: My wife and I built a hybrid timber frame home using this book as a guide. Although we have construction skills, this book was invaluable in guiding us through the process. We can't wait to build another. We highly recommend this book to anyone considering a timber frame house.",0
" Peek a Fun!: We got these as a gift for our one year old. He loves them! He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks - and obviously fails. He loves that some of them move, some of them jiggle, some of them make noise - its almost an adventure!The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside: B - Banana, P - Penguin, U - Umbrella, Z - Zebra.Bonus - when the 1 y/o gets frustrated because he can't pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries, he usually flings them. The 3 y/o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them, or dropping them off high places. And I've stepped on two of them already. They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well.",0
" Perfect book for a long flight....: .... or a lazy afternoon. This book is like watching a romantic movie. It is interesting, feel good and 'tasty'. Capella has done a good job of holding the reader's interest with fun descriptions of food, chefs, Rome, locals and the Italian countryside.I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did. You'll like this book if you are a romantic/ a foodie/ love to travel/ love Italy and Italian food or all of the above.",0
" Perfect for the die-hard baseball fan: I have read Baseball America off and on over the years and finally took the plunge and got a subscription. This is the best place to get coverage of the minors, college, and high school baseball so you know about the top prospects before others do.",0
" PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CD!: I was truly disappointed in this album. The beats are all overused and unoriginal. The only thing that makes this album is Young Turk. He has the hottest rap out of all the Hot Boys. If you haven't heard his freestyle, you don't know what's up. Turk is off da chains. I can't wait for his solo album to drop. Ya'll need to recognize, quit hatin' Turk.",0
" Please try another Hot Boy album...: Guerriula Warfare is an album I fell is something, and that something is everything. The lyrics are most of the time meanless and pointless. Also the beat and backround music of the songs sometimes don't even fit could for the lyrics or how the rapper is rapping. Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something. Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money, just please not this one...",0

 Poor DVD: Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD.,0
" Poor instructions, but once you figure it out... kinda cool: These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in ""hot"" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, ""well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose.""Should be more explicit in the instructions. (We were using the star wars version of this product).",0
" Poor support: I've had the camcorder for a while now, and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas. Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money.",0
" Pretty Nifty!: I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!",0
" Problem with charging smaller AAAs: I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.",0
" Product didn't match the picture/description: Unless they sent me the wrong product by mistake, the foot cushion picture and description does not match the item delivered. I was under the impression I would receive two (a pair) of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes. Instead I received ONE foot cushion, filled with another material (not water) that you attach to your foot via a toe strap. I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund. Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy... they make returns very easy!",0
" Profound then. Truly horrible now.: The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star.",0
 Rapunzel: This is such a great game both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it. I like to play to if they would let me! So much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing Great game. Not at all what you would think a Barbie game would be. Great fun for all!!,0

" Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper.",0
" Review of Artec Textureline Smoothing Serum: I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!",0
 Review of Pillow: This was a joke. I am sending the pillow back. Does not come close to what was advertised. I believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head. I am giving it one star just so I can post this. I only wish the stars could go negative.,0
" Review: This book was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost toward the end. But Patrica is an awesome writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing.",0
" Riveting: I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special ""gifts"" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has ""gifts"" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the ""I hate you!"" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting.",0
" Rochelle explains It All for You: Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book",0
" save your $$$: I can't believe how much this cd sucks, save yourself 17 bucks & just download the ""we on fire"" mp3 its the only decent track on the album. And if u r looking for more ""bounce"" party tracks like ""back that ass up"" too bad; u won't find any here. What a rip.",0
" Scraped across the whole top.: Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen.",0
" Seal IV: I am a huge fan of Seal's first 3 albums, so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out. What a disappointment!! Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes. The only 2 with that eerie signature 'Seal' sound are 'heavenly' and 'tinsel town'. I'd say go to Itunes....listen to the songs...buy the tunes you like (if there are any) and call it a day.",0

" should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle"": The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid.",0
" Simply excellent !!! No Comparision: I am a system analyst with IBM background, client server is totally new for me and being a novice in this area I found this book of immense help. The topics have been beautifully explained. HTML, XML, CSS,DHTML are no longer nightmares for me. I must say that from day one itself I started writing HTMLs. This book is simply great for anybody who would like to learn about HTML. I would recommend this books to beginners as well as experts for reference. The book is worth buying. This is worth 5+ star rating.",0
 sizes recomended in the size chart are not real: sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it,0
 slip on 2 1/2 in. heel shoes: i am completely satisfied in the manner my order was delivered.the shoes are just as awesome as the advertisement showed them to be.,0
" Slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie: 2 stars of 5 for this slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie.",0
" small didn't work: It is very small compared to what i thought it would be, but even so it didn't work when we got it",0
" Smells divine.: This is my second bottle of sheer freesia, I just love this fragrance, its a light delicate sent, beautiful, like a summer day.",0
" smoothing serum: The product is wonderful for my hair which is very curly and tends to be frizzy. Smooths it and gets rid of allof the friz. Use it once a day, even in damp weather",0
" So disappointed: I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are ""deals"" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron.",0
" Solid Addition to the Series: Like the ones before, this book is a solid forensic and police procedural. A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene. How could that have happened? I particularly enjoyed seeing Kay's niece, Lucy, again, as she is 17 now and her own person, no longer a child. Lucy's computer skills continue to amaze. I look forward to reading the next in the series!(Note: There is a continuing bad guy introduced in this book who appears in the next two installments as well. I'd recommend reading this book before The Body Farm and From Potter's Field)",0
 Sony basic Hi8 Handycam Rocks!: Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes. This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony. It does everything I need and does it well... I got a great deal.,0
" Sooo JAMMIN', too trill: Man, some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production, everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man",0
" Soul-mates: I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!",0
" Spellbound!: This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read.",0
 Stiff and Smells like drying paint: You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.,0
" Still Loving Scarpetta: I could not give this book a full 5 starts. For whatever reason, the book seemed to ""bog-down"" and I just wanted it to end. I will continue to read the series, but this one was not my favorite.",0
 Stuning even for the non-gamer: This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate video game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^,0
 super hot: lil wayne and turk set the whole cd off the untamed killer seem to know how to flow. his beats are for real and i cant wait for lil wayne to come out with his solo cd,0

" Sylvania 6620LDG 20"" Flat Panel LCD TV with Built in DVD player: Light weight, space saving very attractive design. Sharp Picture, Good sound quality and quick response time. DVD playback also excellent. Only negative is its remote control. It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use. It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil. The quality, the features and the price still makes this TV an excellent buy.",0
" TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS: I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk.",0
 textbook: Book shipped quickly and was in excellent condition as stated. Easy transaction would buy again,0

" The baseball benchmark: I didn't refer to Baseball America as such. It was Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty who said it. And who am I to contradict? The best columnists in the game, from Peter Gammons, Tracy Ringolsby and Jayson Stark, to detailed information in ALL of baseball, from the Major Leagues to Japan, stats, scores, and the best and most extensive resource on prospect information, there's not a single serious fan in all of baseball who deserves such a title if is not a Baseball America subscriber. You got to read it if you want to know the stars of tomorrow (being tomorrow 6 years or 2 months). Top 10 prospects from every team till its massive Top 100 list, Baseball America covers it all. I know, I have been subscribed for 2 years now, and I can't think of living without it!",0
" The Best !!!!: Dick Curless has got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. His music ranges from thought provoking, to toe tapping, beer drinking music. One of his best renditions is Winter's Coming On Again. People who appreciate good music from any genre will love this CD. I can not recommend it highly enough.",0
" The best soundtrack ever to anything.: I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.",0
 The Best Yet!!!: Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!,0
" The Best: I just re-read Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it. It has everything that you could want and more. Just one questionAre Mary-Lynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart, longing for the one person who can make their life complete?To find out keep reading!!",0
" The food is sexier than the sex: This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose.",0
" The most charming, captivating work from LJ Smith!: The plot and characters are incredible. Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book, and all the other Night World books. I think I'm in love with Ash!",0
 The product I received this time is like fake one: I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount.,0
 The worst rap I ever Heard: This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk.,0
" The Worst!: A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book.",0
" They're blocks - keep that in mind: We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can ""spin"" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a ""look at me"" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)",0
" Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information: To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time.",0

JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ!

" This one is missing that Feehan Spark: This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a ""mystery"" plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read.",0

" This was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny.: I read ""Trouble on Titan"" around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy ""Trouble on Titan.""",0
" Thoughtful, contemporary fiction: Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart.",0
" three to four stars - depending...: Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students.",0

" Too bad....: Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad.",0
" Too Boring: This book had great potential that it did not live up to. I hope she goes back to writing more ""Dark Series"" books. This book needed more action and more editing - it was way too long for the amount of plot it had. :-(",0
" Too Much on the Mystical Plate: The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored.",0
" Too Small: I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. So much for an ""extra"" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy.",0
" Too Uncomfortable and Too Big: These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day.",0
" Unfortunately it wasn't entertaining in the least bit.: When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD. However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie. The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last ""vibe"" Surf Cha Cha. Surfers don't CHA.",0
" unknown Africa: You don't expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced. Me from the white world, don't understand the lyrics, but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa, soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem. The soft almost borred voice of Oliver N'goma fits pefectly in the music. The CD is recorded in France Paris, you can hear that professionals have been working on the CD. A must for a hot, lazy night.greetings Arno, Amsterdam",0
" Unmasked..................: Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres.",0
" Use your imagination!: My 3 year old daughter & I both love this software. We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room. This game allows you to be creative & use your imagination by ""decorating"" each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone & bring him back to life. The music & animation is the best I have seen. Most of the kids software that I've seen is boring to me as an adult, but this is not at all. I sometimes like to play it without her! There are so many variations on color schemes & patterns & that you can never be bored. I highly recommend this for girls of all ages.",0
" Very annoying!: This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus ""feature"" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed.",0
" Very authentic: This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.",0
 Very disappointed!: This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!,0
" Very Frustrating: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the ""power-up segments"" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it.",0
" Very fun and educational: Trains, shapes and pegs - a winning combination, guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy. Good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range.",0
" Very Good: Just as promised, worked well for what I needed. I have some old 8mm tapes and needed a camcorder to play them back on and this fit the bill it also had the USB streaming so I can now transfer them to dvd also the shipping was quick and package great for protection.",0
" Very nice glider: Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. It is quite comfortable and looks nice.",0
 Very Not Worth Your Time: The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages.,0
" Very poor quality.: The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid.",0

" Whispers of the Wicked Saints: This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon.

" Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!: I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their ""rock"" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their ""2 Many DJs"" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, ""Nite Versions"" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release ""Nite Version"" on 12"" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming ""Sexor"" debut...?",0

" Why Some People Complain: The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system.",0
" Will not be purchasing another one of these: It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed.",0
" Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories: I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States.",0
 Wonderful but not worth $80.: These are great blocks but they are definitely not worth the listed $79.99. They can be purchsed for about $20 many other places.,0
" WONDERFUL GOTHIC: I'm not a gothic reader but i bought this book because i'm a big fan of Christine Feehan.I enjoyed this book very much,it had alot of suspense, paranormal and of course romance. The plot was great,i got hooked from the begining. My only question was it did not reveal how the Scarletti brothers got their gift. Christine Feehan did an excellent job and i'm looking forward for her next book,well done.",0
" Wonderful!!!: Wonderful book! Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!",0
" Wonderful. A thorough reference guide.: I needed a comprehensive, intelligent guide covering HTML, DHTML, CSS etc. This book provides that and more in a easy to understand manner, that isn't too simplistic for an advanced web author. A smart layout, and nice index helps you locate what you need fast. Color charts, CSS style references, tag attributes a-plenty, DHTML overviews and in-depth information is there when you need it. If you're looking to spend on a clever guide to take you into the ever expanding world of web technologies, this book is a excellent resource!",0
" Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy: THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world.",0
" Works, but not as advertised: I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger.",0
" Worst music ever....but I love it.: I don't know if you can actually call this music. It is truly terrible. However, I love listening to it for some strange music. ... I am not normally a fan of rap music, but I laugh out loud every time I hear some of these songs. These Cash Money guys should be comedians. Except for Juvenile, since I can't understand anything he says, which is also rather funny. Don't buy it for the music, but it for the comedy.",0
" Worth the investment: This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the ""fun"" factor. For younger babies that may not ""get it"" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months. Give him a couple of months and he'll really dig them!",0
" Worth the wait!: JMM has never released a bad album. Many would say this is a comeback album but every couple of years he releases an album with great hits. For some reason, radio hasn't played some of his great songs from his latest albums. ""Goes Good With Beer"" and ""Little Devil"" would be great singles to spice up country radio. ""Letters From Home"" deserves to be single of the year and ""Cool"" is not far behind. The more I listen to the album, the more I love it.",0
" Worthless and cheap: How is this thing awful? let me count the ways..First off, it took an unatural amount of time to get here. Whatever, that happens.It feels super cheap. When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh.",0
" Would have expected better!: I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters. However, the letters are rubbing off. For the price I paid that was dissapointing. Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun.",0
" Wrong item sent.: I got the shippment quickly. But wrong items was sent. I have to return it to the seller. I got the refund pretty quick, but only for the value of product. I spent about &10 for two way shipping without geting anything.",0
" YES!!!: When I got this book, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I wrong! I loved this book! Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series.",0
" Yet another unsubstantiated case....: While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat.",0
 YOU HAVE ANOTHER WINNER..... CONGRATULATIONS: CHRISTINE HAS DONE IT AGAIN... THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS HER DARK SERIES... WITH JUST ANOUGH SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT - TO SPARK THE INTEREST...

"& I don't really have a solid reason why.  The past few weeks have gotten progressively worse.  It started as simple stress & 3 months later, I just don't want to do it anymore.  No one in my family knows. The only person I tell is my boyfriend and it overwhelms him to the point where he doesn't even reply because he doesn't know what to do.  I called him crying mid panic attack because I didn't know what else to do & he got mad at me saying that I timed it perfectly since he's currently in Las Vegas at a music festival and I was only doing it because he's there.  I wish that were true. I would so much rather be that ""crazy"" girlfriend than to live with the thoughts in my head. He says he cares but will go hours with out checking his phone. He doesn't think its real.the past few weeks, I could feel this darkness inside of me grow and grow. I have cried every night wishing I could just make everything stop.
I've never been suicidal and these thoughts don't make sense to me. I keep trying to convince myself that it's for attention like everyone will think, but I don't think it is. I think about dying every night & how its an escape from tomorrow & every day after that.  I try and think about my family but there seems to be a mental wall where my brain isn't let me see over it.  I can't think about them. I won't allow myself to feel that.  It feels selfish & I feel guilty.
I've lived 22 years with anxiety and depression.  I have journals from 6th grade talking about suicide and how it felt like it was an inevitable thing. I used to self harm when I was 8 to get away from the emotional angst even though I didn't know what I was doing at the time.  This has always been apart of me.
I sought help January of this year and it helped in the beginning but now I feel like this is too much.  I just want to be hospitalized or something out of my own control so I can regain control but I don't have that kind of money and not a single part of me can tell my parents.  I want to tell them so badly so I can get it off my shoulders but I've seen how they react to that sort of thing first hand. They made my sisters feel guilty each time they chose to be hospitalized. Said it was for attention.
I wish it were for attention.",1

"(Apologies for this formidably long read. The rules state that I shouldn't ask for suggestion.I just want tell my story ,put it out here what I've been feeling for years.)I would like to clarify at the outset that  I'm not writing this  out of impulse now. I've been planning my suicide for more than  a year now.I'm 23 now, since I was 11/12 I've always felt I'm a misfit. I've always felt that I'm floating inside my body, I've no purpose in this world. I'm a loser, an evil incarnate, I can never be normal. I realized all this when I was 14/15.Throughout my school and college years ,I've been faking everything-smile,friendship,happiness,etc., Others don't know the face underneath the mask I put on. I've had it enough, I couldn't do the same at work,one day I just came to home without informing anyone at work.And when they tried to contact me ,I avoided itI was terminated. I lied to my friends that I got job in another city.For the past 18 months,I have been lying to them,while planning my suicide. I got hold of sleeping pills.I just want to end it and cause minimal harm to my family. I don't want them to find my body because this is just traumatic , hell it would be great if they didn't even know I was dead and just went missing.I always imagined I would get to a place like those deserts in Breaking bad  TV series and commit suicide. sometime I wish  someone would just kill me and dump in a place like that.alas, I live in third world country, I don't know if there are any such places here. I'm saying all this so that you  would understand where I am coming from and the  suicidal thoughts I have been having since childhood feeling  like a waste of space.So PLEASE don't try to convince me not to, I've heard it all before and it wont help. hell its probably just like what it was like before I was born - nothing - and compared to the pathetic life I live that sounds great to me.please help me.PM me your ideas.Help this world by getting ridding of me.

Now Im in the awkward position of not being willing to go through all the process again, not my best experience and definitely something I wouldnt want to repeat anytime soon.

"...and I must have done something really awful stuff to be sent to hell. This constant and never ending circle of hopelessness, loneliness, false promises, making me believe even just for a fraction of a second that there is a way out, when there isn't, teasing me and then laughing in my face when I realise it's all lies.
I have done something horrible and I'm already dead. And hell is nothing like I imagined. There are no fires and burning for all eternity. Just a repeating simulation of life and then ripping the dreams and hopes out of my heart to punish me for my existence.Thinking back all the way to my childhood, I had dozens of surgeries even before I was 6, promising me to fix me but then another surgery and another promise. I started school and started it again at another school, going to high school and finishing it at a second one, then more surgeries, more promises to be normal, more false hopes to ever being a father, only to be laughed at when people realise what I was born with (or without), going to uni and taking that away from me then a second uni and taking that away from me too. Working my ass off to build up a career and either let me screw up or snatch it out of my hand so everything I've built and worked hard for comes crushing down on me. Over and over and over and over again.Wait until I just about to have enough, give me something to hold onto, watch me build something again and then just when I start to feel it's worth living, take it away and throw me back into the pit.Schools, jobs, relationships, hobbies, friends, crushes, love... none of that is real. Just tools of torture that is out of my control.And the only way to break that cycle is to kill myself again. Then erase my memory, grown up again, torture me again, then kills myself again and the circle never ends.What other explanation is there? I know it's my fault. It has to be.I get the message. Whoever sent it to me. I must do a reset, soon. Die again by my own hands, get sent deeper into the bowls of hell and see how long it takes until I realise again I need to die once more. And again and again and again.I have a countdown. A deadline I set years ago. I need to bring it forward and stop waiting. Stop trying. Stop living. Just... stop.",1

"[LONG]as the sun sets, he finds a cottage up ahead which is two stories tall. The man enters and is greeted by a Chinese man. He asks the man if he can stay the night, to which the Chinese man agrees, but only under the condition that the traveller does not lay a finger upon his daughter.""You touch her one time, I inflict the three time punishment onto you.""The man agrees to the terms and stays the night. However, while sleeping, he is awoken by the beautiful daughter of the Chinese man. She seduces the traveller and they end up making love the whole night. Upon waking up in the morning, the groggy traveller realizes his arm is tied to the bedpost. There is a note attached to the string that says ""right arm tied to bedpost"". The man quickly cuts off the rope and gets up. He tries to move but notices his left foot is tied too, with a note that reads ""left foot tied to cupboard"". He thinks, ""huh, this isn't so bad"".The man again manages to cut off the rope and free himself, at which time he hears the Chinese man walking up the stairs. He panicks and jumps out the window, but then sees a note tied to a piece of rope he did not notice:""Left testicle tied to bedpost.""",0

"144 IQ. That's 99.83th percentile. I also have a MS and BA from top ten schools. Can't figure this out, somehow.I'm too old to attract someone I am attracted to. I see dozens of attractive women every day on my way to my no-growth temp job and even more on OKCupid. I'm just never good enough. Response rate to individually tailored messages is about 1-2%, and that's just to get a foot in the door. Given a response, ~80% will string me along on chat until what I can only presume is the hotter one of the ten other men talking to them that day asking them to come over and a subsequent drop off the face of the earth. If a date is somehow drawn from the stone, it is a free meal for her and amazing stress for me to not fuck up. I just get exasperated and end the night if they don't first. I'm so tired of performative bullshit to get even the minute chance of success. Why doesn't anyone ever try to impress me. Every time I have to put myself out there and just never feel like I have any intrinsic value.It feels like I need extrinsic value like prestige or money to be attractive. Get a job, my female relatives say. Doesn't that prove it is the money or status that is loved, rather than me? I have a temp job in chicago now and I'm behind where a ivy graduate should be [42k at 29 years old in a temp position]. its just not enough to make me worth something. im so tired of not being loved for who I am and envy the attention women get.

"17 y/o here. I have been depressed and hopeless for almost my entire teenage life. My parents don't really give a shit about me, and I hate my mom for letting her alcoholic boyfriend abuse me when I was 11 or 12. At school I have mostly no friends beyond simple ""acquaintances"" who I say hi to and leave. I have a lot of trouble talking about my emotions to people in real life, and I often drive people away from me. This summer I had a group of friends who I hung out with frequently, this was the only time in my life where I have ever felt accepted and loved. The girl who I love only wants to fuck stupid tinder guys, and she leads me on because I am worthless. I'm so much of a retard I fucked things up with everyone and now I truly am alone again.Everyday I wake up I feel as though I am being tortured further with the weight of being alive. I can't stand the thought of living another day on this dejected planet where I am nothing. Unwanted is all I am. I wish I wasn't filled with so much rage. I've tried counseling, I've tried pills but there's nothing that can be done. I am hopeless.At school all I can think about is how much I hate everyone around me, and I get strong urges to self harm (hitting my self, cutting, beating my head on things). I know that if my life continues like this I will take my life. I hate living in my own body. I just want to be loved and love everyone but I never will get any of that. I want to be free from myself and my mind, I want to at least feel some love or something good before I die. ",1

"21 year old male diagnosed with bpd (borderline personality disorder)Ive been unemployed for weeks now because my parents took the car and phone so I couldn't even call in sick to work when I was working just fine at a local car wash and making enough money to pay bills and save for the future, I am constantly getting kicked out,  (at least once every 2-3 weeks usually spanning 3-4 sometimes 5 days) where I am either sleeping in my car (now titled in my name thank God, it wasn't when the took the keys), or luckily finding a place to sleep at a friends house.I have my issues. I admit it to anyone that knows me and I always try to make amends when I wrong someone including family members. But anytime I do something wrong my parents jump the gun and go to kicking me out. I know the answer is get a job, save up, get your own place etc.And not to sound like someone trying to just complain with no solutions because I AM actively working towards that, but what many people don't understand with a disorder like mine (bpd) is the inconsistency of your mental state and mind can cause impulsivity and self destruction almost constantly.What I'm trying to say is, it seems like people like myself can work towards a better life for a while and seem to make progress (I had my own apartment and was paying rent at 20) ONLY to self sabotage everything you've worked so hard for in a fit or stress or rage. Example: I lost my job of seven months and got evicted from said apartment because I was so impulsive I decided it was a better idea to get drunk and do drugs with a girl I liked and call in sick to work the next day. I know damn well I shouldn't do shit like this but I feel like I have the impulse control of a toddler but with the intelligence and awareness of exactly what I am doing to destroy my life like a grown adult.I don't know how to fix myself anymore besides ending my life. I don't know what hope there is for people like me and it's sad because most everyone who knows me loves me, because they don't see my borderline personality up close and in action, they just see me as the intense, overly friendly type person they know and love. So there is little understanding and I get talked down to by most people I go to looking for advice (forums, Reddit, counseling, family) because well, the solution is easy, quit doing stupid shit to fuck up your life??I've been to jail for battery, I've overdosed on stimulant drugs on two occasions, I've been hooked on painkillers, been hooked on alcohol. Yet people tell me I'm one of the ""kindest, most sincere people they know"" and that I've made a huge impact on their life. I don't understand how because I don't see how they see any value in me. I'm a total fuck up.Yes a lot of this is rambling but I am genuinely at a crossroads now where I feel like I am worn out with the rollercoaster I've been living on. I feel like death is an easy solution because I won't have to deal with the pain and the lows associated with my chronic fuck ups anymore. It's not fun being a completely capable and intelligent human being in most respects, and just having one part of your personality which you are all to aware of come unhooked at the worst times in life. I mean shit, I went to jail the DAY before a good job interview which could've drastically improved my quality of life. I told myself don't do anything stupid, if you fuck this opportunity at this job up you're going to be SOL for another few weeks/ months and just repeat the cycle.Back to the point of all this. I'm unemployed and have been for weeks, living with my parents but typing this on my phone in my car in a Walmart parking lot because I got kicked out for the 4th time in 3 months for my own negative actions. I am hooked on steroids and need them to function, hooked on cigarettes and if I quit I get withdrawals which isn't fun but I guess isn't the end of the world, don't have my Adderall so idk if I will be able to function at all at a job (Yes these things do improve my daily functioning majorly, which is a big deal if you're someone like me who just struggles to function in general), I just don't even know. Fuck the rollercoaster. I know a lot of this may sound trivial to many, but that's another thing with bpd. EVERYTHING is the end of the world and you can't stop that dramatic life or death feeling. Losing love with someone feels like you lost your spouse of decades, hearing petty remarks from strangers that are taken the wrong way can spark intense internal rage which can be hard to control, etc etc etc. Fuck borderline personality disorder. It's hell and I commend anyone living with this disorder and encourage you to keep going strong for me. It's just hard. We have a 10% suicide rate. That's right, one out of 10 bpds just kill themselves because they can't take it. Fuck it maybe I'll joinemmmmm",0

"A couple weeks ago I was happier than I've ever been. I was at my college, a beautiful place I love where I have tons of friends, basically living my dream considering I've had social problems all throughout middle-high school. Then to make a long story short the student financial department fucked me and my parents over and I was uprooted from my friends and the place I was living in the middle of the week, they literally forced me to leave. It was awful, and it's actually not the first time something similar has happened to me before. Now I am home (my college is 7 hours away) in a place where I have no friends, no job, and not even taking classes. I have no one to talk to, I still talk to my friends from school but I can't talk about stuff like this or it'll freak them out. I used to see a therapist but my mom doesn't want to pay for it anymore and I have no money. My home life has always been incredibly toxic and my parents have always been a major contributor to my depression and anxiety. I just feel like...worthless. Like a worthless individual. I don't have a job and I'm not doing anything and I have no motivation to even leave the house let alone my bed. All my life shit like this has continued to happen to me and sometimes I look at all the pills I have to take and consider just shoving a handful in my mouth and ending it all, but most of the time I just lie in my bed and wish I could die without actually having to kill myself because I'm a coward. I'm so tired of hearing that things are gonna get better because for me ",0

"A few years ago I found a list with statements like ""do you ever feel empty"" and you had to pick a number from 1-5 depending how you feel about it. I found these documents in my dads home office along with a funeral speech he wrote about his own funeral. It was something along the lines of ""In a few generations no one will remember him"" etc. This was a years ago, I copied everything and it's still in my old room. I was still a teenager at this time. In my teens up to my 20s I had depression. Like a lots of families we have never talked about mental illness and it took me 5 years to admit I was in therapy. There wasn't really a reaction from my parents to it. If I didn't say anything about it we would have never addressed it again. I don't think they didn't care but they didn't know what to say. Move on a few years I'm doing fine again. I was having a chat with my parents and my dad said he is now engaging in some kind of gun club (owing a gun is illegal in my country - you need to join a gun club, be active there and do a training). I asked why he's doing that he said I thought about it for a long time and now he just went for it. My dad is really liberal and if I asked him 2-3 years ago about guns he would say that he would never use one and he was really anti-guns in general. I asked him a bit more about it and he said he's planning on storing guns at home (for which you need even more training and stuff). Later he commented that only he had access to it and might need it a day. The point is: it's really nothing my dad would have ever done. It might be some kind of midlife crises but maybe it's not. The comment ""I need them some day"" was really weird and out of place (they don't live in a dangerous area at  all and even if they did his general opinion would have been that guns don't help that). I don't know if he ever had therapy or something but it seems so. He's been looking really happy these days which is also confusing. Something seems off but maybe I'm just overthinking.Could use some advice on whether to address this or not and how to do it. Thanks in advance. ",1

"A person with suicidal thoughts is not normal... and they know it...
For many a years they will fight to be normal try to do normal people things that make normal people normal though they don't know they are normal because being normal is everyday for them even when bad things happen to them the are simply cured by doing the normal things with other normal people.
But we don't even have the normal things to rely on no regular friends who would come over for tea and a chat, a mad sesh on the town, or even a phone call, be it bffs, work or a an activity.
And when they finally do travel so far down the lonely road with only their thoughts for company and jump, shoot, swallow and kick... everyone wonders why they never came to them I mean they would always be their if they asked it says so in the facebook post...
Always here, are you ?__________
I would like to see five of my friends post this message (not sharing) to show that you are always there if someone needs to talk. I think I know who will xxYou can never be part of the normals when they finally learn how damaged and truly abnormal you are, talking doesn't help it just creates a toxic dependency that no side wants inclusion in the normals is all we want being part of the group being wanted and thought of when anything is going down helps so much people would probably live if the people in their lives helped them to live instead of remind them of how abnornal they are...
I know this because I was pulled from a river after my fifth attempt the first public one so now the people closest to me know and still they leave me alone despite declarations of help and company being only a text or phone call away...
They never reply... they never come and I am still barely here wishing to be normal but instead we are alone with our past, our pain and reality
stop talking and start doing invite the weird kid from class to the cinema, the shy colleague to the work night out, the mom who never leaves the house because kids... just let them know you see them its all we want",1

"A wealthy man had a little boy. For some reason, his first words were ""ping pong ball"". When the boy was old enough to speak, and understand birthdays and gifts and such (about three years old), he asked the boy ""So son, what would you like for your birthday this year?"" The boy said, ""Daddy, I would like a pink ping pong ball."" Father said ""That's it? No trucks, no trains no puzzles?"" The boy said ""No, just a pink ping pong ball.So the father gets him the pink ping pong ball and wraps it up. The boy is absolutely delighted. He takes the pink ping pong ball to his room, and the pink ping pong ball is never seen again.A day before his 15th birthday, asked by his father, `Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?' The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have five pink ping pong balls.The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is pink ping pong balls that you want, a pink ping pong balls you shall have. And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday presents five pink ping pong balls. The boy took the pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong balls were gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. He said therefore, `If it is a ten pack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a ten pack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a ten pack of pink ping pong balls. The boy took the ten pack of pink ping pong balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ping pong ball remained, merely the empty husk of the ten pack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' `A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humor me, dear father.' The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humor his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. `Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. The next day, the father took his son to the harbor and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. You've made me very happy yet again.' That night, the son spent on board the tanker. The next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy. A few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital. His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' Weakly, the son sat up in bed. `Father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one ten pack of pink ping pong balls.' The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son, but I have to give you one condition. Even if it may be embarrassing, I must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.' `Very well, father, but please indulge me first. I will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.' The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. Son, I leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.The son nodded weakly. The next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room. Now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls, the father requested. The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. `I-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth. `I- I-' Then he died. ",0

"Nobody expected Walter Lynn to walk into the high school reunion in his watermelon costume. Heck, no one thought he was even going to show up, considering how he didn't show up to his 7th birthday party. He told us at school the next day that he was worried we were going to laugh at him for wearing some stupid birthday cone hat because it wasn't shaped like a regular hat. Walter was always weird like that; he worried constantly that people judged every move he made, so he always stayed seated and started his homework while the rest of us were letting hell lose whenever the teacher turned his back. He was so boring that even his middle name was Meh.  I mean, he wasn't a total loser- he was just blander than overcooked chicken. Mr. meh never made any jokes cause we might think they were a bust, he never dated anyone because he thought he might be disliked and he never walked out of his house unless it was to get to school or Sunday mass. I remember how we first met: it was back in Sister Adonit's Kindergarten class and we had to come up and make up a sentence with a word provided by the teacher. For example, I started off the class with the word minor: I fell and got a minor cut  The next person, Ralph Petrucio had the word girl, so he said Walter identifies as a girl. Although he got hit with Sister's sweet meter stick of justice, everyone thought that he was hilarious because he actually did look like a girl. The next person up was Janet, with bicycle. Wanting to follow up Ralph's joke, ends up saying:  Walter is a bisexual  At this point we might as well have called Kindergarten The Roast of Walter Lynn because he was getting redder than the disgusting glop that the lunch ladies kept on insisting was meatloaf. I personally would have done the same if Ralph had came up with the idea before I went up. By the 7th sentence Walter had ran out of the room in tears, leaving behind him a trail that confused our Native American students from the actual one. The day after Sister had forced the class to apologize for acting like heathens and pagans, but the damage was already done: he never said another word in class for the next 9 years. We surprisingly became acquaintances because I didn't think of making fun of him, which I believe was the smartest life choice I've ever made. Mr. meh always sent me his homework and test answers, resulting in me becoming the salutatorian. After our graduation, Walter claimed he was moving to Britain although someone spotted him hiding in his closet.  Fastforwarding 20 years, he sent me a message on Facebook asking for the details about the Reunion.

"About 15 years ago I posted on Usenet about my depression and suicidal ideation. Actually, I'd emailed somebody and they put it up for me -- except they actually put my full name there and email. I was mortified and just withdrew from the whole thing. I'm not sure, I don't remember too well.The search result pretty much disappeared from Google. I don't know what the mechanics of it were, but however. And I was able to forget about it.About three days ago I discovered, though, that due to Google Groups caching all of Usenet (I don't know when, and I'm no tech expert) a Google search for my name brings up this particular post in the top five or six results.I can't describe how I feel now. I've barely slept in the past few days. Have been trying to get it taken down somehow. Emailing Google. Trying to report it as effectively containing medical records, etc, as this is one of the few things Google takes things down for.Have tried doing a DMCA takedown of it, but no avail.It's almost sort of ironic that in recent years I've largely won in my battle against the Black Dog. But this has somehow plunged me to the point of really wanting to just top myself. Knowing that family and friends will have seen this post -- I don't know how many months it's been there, I don't make a habit of Googling myself. God only knows what impact it's had work-wise -- perhaps that's part of why my freelance work has been shit beyond belief. Not that I should make excuses, but still.It feels like I'm kind of being hounded by it to do it. That, with my ideation and darkest thoughts from before being dragged up like this, I have to somehow make sense of it by killing myself.I can't think straight as I'm completely sleep-deprived. But it feels like I can't sleep until I've solved the issue. And the easiest way, it feels, for me to solve the issue sejumpems to be to just fuck everything and find a busy highway now to walk in front of a car at, as my stated intentions from however many years ago were.",1

"After arguing and it not being the same, my girlfriend ended our relationship. She had been my first girlfriend at uni so the first person I'd spent so much time with: living together, eating together etc. I've always had anxiety and she was always there to help me with it, always understanding and there for me. Over summer we visited each other and she was with me at my dads wedding which was a huge thing for me. As time passed the distance began to take its toll. I'd recently started on anti depressives which effected my sex drive which started to become a huge weight on my shoulders. I became increasingly embarrassed about it but didn't know what to say to anyone. Stupidly while we were getting into things I tried watching 'material' on my phone. She saw this and it broke her. I didn't realise how self conscious she was and how much it effected her. After coming back from the summer and back to university I hoped things would return to normal but it was obvious she was distancing herself from me and it was becoming awkward between us. She took me away for my birthday but it was obvious how awkward it was between us. She gave me my birthday present the day after and I tried everything to spark a conversation between us but because I felt so anxious I couldn't even maintain or start a conversation, I oversaw her speaking to another guy on her phone also which really shook me. Sunday night she came over and ended it. She told me that it had changed for her and that what I did messed her up. She said there was nothing I could do to make her feel comfortable anymore. We both said this isn't how we wanted it to go - but it's the way it's ended up. I told her that I would have to unfollow her on social media and she told me that she didn't really give a shit. I cried uncontrollably, and went to bed. I woke up the next morning feeling a low I never had before and went to buy two bottles of wine. After drinking them two I deleted any social media I had which alerted my family and I was bombarded with texts of worry but I couldn't face anyone. After going through my camera and deleting all the images of her from my dads wedding something snapped, and I decided that I'd had enough. I tried to overdose on my anti anxiety medication, but after googling it I realised that wasn't likely so I decided to look for a pencil sharpener so that I could cut my wrists. As I was looking my mom called me; I picked up and cried uncontrollably. Speaking to my sister and my dad they contacted one of my house mates who stayed with me. My dad travelled up and took me to A & E. I spoke about my issues and we discussed a plan. After taking me back home I insisted that my dad went home as I didn't want to be a burden. Waking up this morning I immediately had an urge to find a razor again, luckily my mom had came up to check and found me. The crisis team was called out and I have just kept crying on and off. I feel lost, in riddled with guilt and have no idea how to deal with it, I would have never have hurt her on purpose and I can't believe that I was so shallow to do something like that to her. She helped me through so much anxiety, but now it seems she doesn't care and I feel so lonely. I'm scared because I don't know how I will react or what I will do from hour to hour. Suicidal thoughts come and go, I just feel incredibly lost.",1

As a Senior, nothing hurts more than to be rejected by the one you truly love and care for to reject and tell you you aren't good enough. This friend I cared for, she told me everything, she was a big part of my thoughts. I hate myself for being so mushy and vulnerable, but I can't escape these feelings and the longer life goes, the larger the desires to be cared for are. My life is beginning to spire down and this is one of the reasons why.I am pathetic and disgusting for saying this, but the only thing I want is someone to spend time with, a girlfriend.

"An old woman was chatting with her next door neighbor, and when he mentioned that he was going away to college and could not take his parrot with him, she asked him what he would do with the bird. 
""Ah, I'll give 'em to the pet store. Somebody else's problem.""
Well this just would not do for this church-going woman, so she offered to take the bird off the young man's hands. He insisted, ""Ah no, Miss Wainwright, you don't want this old bird! He used to belong to my father before he passed, and he's got a real mouth on him."" 
Gladys insisted right back and sealed the deal with saying how lonely she would be without him to help her with the gardening. The young man relented, shaking his head, and thinking to himself that he had warned her before passing the cage off.The bird was quiet the first night, and Gladys figured that all the bird really needed was to get away from those loud video games. 
The next morning she awoke and walked downstairs to the kitchen, passing the cage on the way. 
""HEY OLD BITCH! WHERE THE HELL'S MY FUCKIN' FOOD?"" The parrot screeched at her.
Shocked, she turned slowly on the spot to stare at him. And then she spoke, ""Now I don't know what you got up to next door, but that just won't be tolerated here!""
""FUCK YOU, DRIED UP OLD CUNT!"" 
Gladys snatched the bird out of the cage and carried him to the kitchen, ignoring his loud curses and wing flapping. She held him up and said to his beak, ""You need to be taught some manners! You sit in here and think about your language, birdy!""
She popped him in the freezer and turned away to make some tea. 
When the kettle had boiled a minute later, she opened the freezer to reveal a shuddering parrot that was glaring at her, but saying nothing. Smiling in a satisfied way, she removed him and placed him back in his cage. 
The next morning, Gladys totters down the steps and coos, ""Good morning my pretty little birdy!""""AH, FUCK THIS! YOU CAN SUCK MY FEATHERY COCK LADY!"" Gladys promptly popped the bird in the freezer again, but this time while boiling the kettle her daughter called. By the time she had gotten off the phone with her third grandchild, she realized she had quite forgotten the bird.
Hustling back over to the freezer as fast as her rheumatism would allow, she wrenched open the door and found her bird alive, nearly frozen. As she removed him the bird said in a small voice, ""Alright lady, I'm real sorry... But I gotta ask.. What the HELL did that turkey say?""",0

I guess I should give more information about myself. You can call me E. I'm 18 and from the United States, but currently living in Germany. What am I doing in Germany? I left everything behind, my parents, my ""freinds"" (I'll touch on that later) followed the only person that I loved, a girl who was a foreign exchange student at my school last year, I had worked so hard to find a school where I could study in english and still be in the same city as her. Yeah well you can guess how that worked out. She knew I was coming across the world, I had paid for my college, rented an apartment, and was 100% committed to her. And she still fucking left. Just like everyone else. And guess what. She replaced me with somebody who looks almost exactly like me. A FUCKING DOPPELGANGER. I've gotten messages from people asking if it was me. Yeah no it fucking isn't. Anyways, I'm in Germany now, and I don't speak a word of German. I've gone through my schools international department for everything, but I have nothing done yet. I don't have health insurance, I don't even have a full student visa, only my 90 day entrance visa and that's running out soon. But that's the least of my worries. I'm sure I sound whiny. Go ahead and criticize me if you want, you can't say anything worse about me than I've already thought about myself. Anyways, after all the fucked up shit she did, I still love her. But that's not the only reason I envision death. Not only have I lost her, I've lost all my close friends that I've known for years. People I grew up with. People who watched me grow up. Just gone. Why? I'll give you some examples of the last conversation I had with some. I asked ""Hey, I'm feeling down again today, I don't really know what to do, can you help?"" Their reply was ""Ask someone else, I really don't want to hear it anymore"". Even today, I asked another ""Hey man, can you talk?"" and got the response ""Can I? Yeah I can.

Anxiety and depression have taken over every aspect of my daily life. I cant control it anymore. Everyday suicide starts to make more sense. Im sick of crying myself to sleep every night. Im sick of thinking my friends constantly hate me when i know they dont. Im sick of not eating. Im sick of being tired all the time. Im sick of having parents who refuse to talk to me about these things. I cant enjoy anything anymore. I cant remember the last time i was truly happy. I dont want to live like this anymore. I just cant do this anymore. I feel so fucking lonely.I just want to die.,1
Anxiety-fuelled suicidal thoughts,1
"Any bad situation in my life, no matter how insignificant it is, makes me want to kill myself - awkward social interaction, being criticized by others etc. Not sure why this happens, oftentimes I think something is seriously wrong with me and I lack the survival instinct others have, since I want to give up on life so easily. IMO, life is worthless and the bad moments greatly outweigh the good ones, in quantity and quality, so I don't care if I stop living. ",1

"Anywhere, even anonymously. Even mentioning in normal life that I don't feel my life has purpose or meaning gets me pity and pep talks at best, and not terribly subtle hints to stop the conversation or withdrawal from friendships at worst. And while I don't know for sure what saying offline that I want to die (and in fact have multiple plans with multiple pro and con lists in my head) would get me, I'm pretty sure it would involve a two-way ticket to the psych ward along with all the negative impacts on the life I would have to go directly back to afterward that that would entail.I'm mid-30's, female, childless, single. Just got dumped in a really ugly and protracted way by someone I should have known better than to mess with in the first place, actually. I'm not close to my own family, who were abusive and/or nonsupportive, but haven't completely cut ties with them either. I have friends, but friends in your 30's are not what friends in your 20's and earlier are, and most if not all have priorities which come (and legitimately should come) far above a seemingly pretty stable if not entirely happy friend. Hell, even above an unstable friend. I was seeing a therapist for a long time. She was very kind but ultimately not that helpful, but that is not my point. I mention her to say that anytime I would mention how much I felt I was lacking due to not having a family, she would push the idea that I could have friends who were ""like"" family, no matter how much I would say that wasn't what I wanted.The thing is, I don't really believe in that. I wouldn't say it is fake, but I would say it is a simile rather than a literal truth. ""Like"" family. But not really family. The degree of permanency, loyalty, even a certain amount of closeness is not the same. Yes, I could get myself some invites to some awkward, third-wheel Thanksgivings. Even have, in the past, though many of those ""like family"" friends have since drifted away, proving my point all too well. But for what?The thing is, I want the real thing. I feel so awfully unlovable... and then, the greatest mindfuck of all is how much I feel there is something wrong with me for feeling that and typing that, even totally anonymously.I also feel very ungrateful. I have a solidly OK job and career path. Not great, but solidly OK. I pay the bills. I'm enrolled in a graduate program, part-time. I have a safe, affordable place to live, even if I simultaneously feel very trapped there and it is less than ideal in a number of ways. I have pets. I have the aforementioned friends. And I barely have the focus, will and energy to keep it all barely together in all these domains despite all the many responsibilities I don't have that most people do at my stage of life. But still, I feel ungrateful for not wanting this life, and even seriously considering ending it on a regular basis, when others have it so much worse and my life is by all objective standards a fortunate one.",1
"Apologies for the formatting and grammar errs in advance. English is not my mother tongue and I ain't no smart either.I don't know if I'll succeed this time. But I think I will. It will be painful but I promise myself the pain will only last for few seconds then there will be peace, endless peace. At least for me. I don't know if its against the rules to post gruesome details of how will I do it but yes, I'll jump on raging traffic and place my head under a ten-wheeler truck. I just can't find any other way; a gun is way too expensive and I find jumping off a bridge, from a building or by hanging being too cliche. I don't want to be an inconvenience to the public but getting my head crushed is the easiest I could find. At least it will guarantee my death. Enough with how I plan to end it but this is my story.I'll save you my personal information but so long as I can remember, I've been depressed and suicidal for 7 years; 6 and half to be precise since I wouldn't be here in October in anyway. I started to develop depression after I was kicked out in the Seminary. I was in Highschool Seminary and I've always wanted to serve God and become a priest but alas, I was in High School. I bullied and got bullied, it's a common standard. Albeit I befriended myself (I was on Junior High) with a Freshman. He has no friends whatsoever since he was not friendly to anybody. I can't exactly remember what started our feud but I bullied him since for his ungratefulness; I was his only friend yet he does not treat me so kindly. I can't remember how we reconciled and became friends again later on. I don't know if it was part of his master plan but since I was in High School (and a virgin), we begun perversely mocking our teachers especially our librarian. There I made an indecent letter addressed to our librarian to allow me to have sex with her, signed with a forged signature of our monsignor. He took the letter and reported me; to which I beat him up for. Few days later, the council had a meeting and decided to not allow me to enroll in the seminary for the following year. I was devastated. I pleaded badly. I sent letters to the Seminary formators and the Archbishop himself and found out the prick made a story that I had an affair with him, making my situation worse. Didn't realize I will never recover from this.Then begun my trust issues. I graduated High School in a different school with less friends than I had before. I went to College and found new friends but my trust issues later kicked in and I transferred to another school. This time, it was worse. My anxiety and trust issues were so severe I was unable to make any friends, none whatsoever. I'm in a four-year course and sadly, I'm on my sixth year now due to failing grades and tons of no-grade status. I took same courses consistently for 2 semesters while barely hanging by a thread. I had two probations, and it took me 5 semesters to finish 2 semester- CWTS/ROTC. I went 6 years in college with literally no friends. I eat alone, everyday somewhere far where nobody would recognize me. I don't hang out with anyone nor I can't remember having any decent conversation with anybody. I always find a way to avoid people even to the point of punishing myself for them to avoid me. The anxiety was so severe, I purposely don't brush my teeth nor apply deodorant just so people would avoid me. Albeit that didn't stop them from inviting me to fraternities which I politely refuse. You see, I get easily irritated like every depressed people. I may not look like one but I'm freakishly strong; probably because of pent up anger within me. I often try to channel my frustration through boxing and picking fights but that doesn't seem to satisfy me. Sex also doesn't soothe me. It's a temporary pleasure but it doesn't help me in a long-shot. I even thought I was homosexual since girls doesn't seem to satisfy me but the thought of having sex with another guy disgusts me. Never went down that road but I'm pretty sure I'm straight. Anyway, the only courses left for me next semester are seminars and On the-Job-Trainings to which I fear I won't succeed. I've never made any friends in college and envy my sister for living the life I wish I had. I love my family, I really do. This is why I've survived 7 years of suicidal depression just for them. I've hurt them before, both mentally and physically (thrice: hit my sister twice and boxed with my father which I clearly lost). I'm not proud of it, I can't control myself but they love me still. They didn't realize my condition until last year where it had gone so severe that I was barely about to hide it. I started banging my head against a wall until I pass out about 3 years ago. Every morning I cry myself out on how I was still alive, hoping I wasn't able to wake up. Every night I hope will be my last. But it never came. I tried-to many to count stupid, menial suicide attempts. I've strangled myself with a blanket, drowned myself in a pail, bought sleeping pills from the black market but all of that, I was able to resist. My body somehow instinctively survives and resists them. I remember passing out after I strangled myself with a blanket and woke up with my arms unwrapping them. I remember waking and coughing up blood in the bathroom after trying to drown myself. I remember my hair went crazy after I showered and stuck my fingers on the socket without my hands being burnt to crisps. I remember waking up after continuously banging my head on the concrete wall on my room with blood everywhere and surviving. I've always find a way for my family not to notice it. I'm quick to work on cleaning the blood stains and covering what happened. I don't want them to see any physical attempts of suicide. I even bought a neck bracer to hide the ruffs on my neck.Then I begun hearing voices. I know it's me but it feels like someone else. It wanted me to kill my family whom I loved dear. The voices were overwhelming I begun banging my head in-front of my family hoping it would stop. It concerned them so bad. Several weeks later, they overheard me singing some kind of suicide song, dizzy from continuous head banging. Later at the end of that semester, they sent me to rehab. They conspired with a psychiatrist to which I revealed everything. They drugged me, kidnapped me and had my ass on rehab. It didn't help. Rehab feels like a deterrent instead of a recovery. I stayed for a month in the facility and deterred any physical manifestations of my suicidal tendencies after I got out. I no longer bang my head on a concrete wall, I just punch the shit out of it. I boxed, so I know where to hit it.I learned from my psychiatrist I'm diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder with extreme suicidal tendencies. Coupled with social anxiety, agora phobia, severe trust issues, anti-social personality disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and PTSD. PTSD not from a life-threatening situation but PTSD from getting kicked out of the seminary. I've met all the conditions except the first requirement.I don't want to leave my family but if I continue to live my life, I might end up doing something I regret. I don't want to hurt my family nor anyone else ever again. I'm doing myself a favor. No one is going to love someone like me. I'll save my future children some problems, I don't want them to inherent my depression. I forgot to mention I'm no longer religious. I never had God with me nor felt any divine presence ever since I acquired depression. I was all alone. Despite the family support and help, I still feel alone. And I would rather die alone. If this was karma for all the wrongs I've did, I believe this is too excessive of a punishment. If there is a good God, I don't know why my depression is part of his plan or anything. If there is hell, well, I rather be there instead of being here. I just hope they can never uncover my plan. I'm tired guys. I really am. It's selfish to commit suicide but I don't think I'll be any of good use in the future. I'll be an inconvenience. Depression made me stone-cold. I had crushes but I never felt love. Sex wasn't love, it was fun. What's sad is the only thing that keeps me alive today and wanting to live for the following years are TV-shows and movies. That's all. Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Lucifer, DBZ super, Avengers, Justice League, etc. I've watch too many shows and movies alone. The only imaginry friends I had were TBBT, HIMYM and FRIENDS. But I think none of that will matter. I won't remember anything of that when I'm dead anyway.2 week countdown from now. I'll wait for the semester to end. I'll die with fashion, wearing my favorite jeans, shoes and shirt. I'll be busy preparing my death, farewell letters and stuff. Plus, I major in Psychology. At least it will send a signal to my batchmates to start helping depressed individuals. Goodbye Reddit. I know nobody or few would bother to read this but still. Bye!",1

"As long as i remember I never grew up with a real family. I was taken from my mom when i was two because she neglected me. Im the bastard of a half blind, fat, bald and bipolar nutcase. I spent my childhood in a grouphome, moving from place to place leaving friends and belonging behind without any warning. I was constantly bullied because i was skinny and sickly from all the fucked up meds they shoved in my mouth to shut me up. I had frequent violent manic outbursts, hurting the other kids who bullied me. I couldnt fucking take all the abuse. I finally was put in a foster home where I spent a year and a half in what seemed to be solitude. I was told i was gonna be adopted by some married couple who also adopted my brother who i never met. I thought i was gonna finally be able to live in peace. My brother is a complete fucking asshole, he constantly provoked me to go on a rampage for his own amusement and would enjoy playing with me as i helplessly tried to hit my 14 year old brother (i was 6). Eventually they couldnt take my shit anymore and sent me off to a foster home again. I went through 3 other failed adoptions, being tormented my others and treated like dogshit. I was no more than a extra set of helping hands and/or a punchingbag. they treated me like i was a item they could take back for a refund whenever they wanted. All of this made me into a introverted socialy inept fuckstick who cant even start a conversation without looking like a complete fool. and worst of all im now 17 years old a senior with no friends. Im a kissless virgin who has almost never talked to a girl in his life. THAT'S the worst part, i just want to fall in love with somebody, i feel like everything i ever wanted or needed in my life was flat out denied to me. I feel like i dont even belong in life. I've attempted once and ended up in the hospital. I feel like my life just isnt worth it. I dont even feel human anymore. Maybe ill finally get the guts to do it again and this time i wont fuck up for once in my life. So long fuckers",1

"because nobody would care aside from your closest family/friends? They'd probably only care because they felt like they had to. And sooner or later they'd realize that they're much better off without you. And you're such an obvious failure that everyone you know tangentially would not give half a shit, maybe they'd even be slightly impressed that you had finally done your worthless self in. They all think you're a laughing stock, maybe they'd see you as a human being capable of emotion if you killed yourself. But then they'd see more of you than you've ever offered, and the fact that you can't control your own image and legacy beyond the grave scares you so much that you can't even bring yourself to just end it. You don't want to be ""the guy that killed himself"" but you really, truly want to die. You fantasize about having died in a childhood accident, before you ever proved your worthlessness as a person. Maybe people would've cared back then.This is my life right now. I figured one day I'd start mustering up the courage to fight it, but I think I'm slowly mustering up the courage to end it. ",1

"Bill was a big tractor enthusiast, he really had a passion for them. He collected tractors for many years and had gotten quite the collection, a total of about 50+ tractors.One day Bill was looking online at some tractors when he saw one that really caught his eye. A tractor made of solid gold! Bill knew he had to have it so he picked his best tractor and drove it all the way to the owners house in hopes of buying the magnificent golden tractor.He arrives and speaks to the owner, offering him 100,000 for the tractor. The man refused, he said the tractor meant far too much to him. Bill then offered the man his entire collection of tractors in exchange for his golden tractor. The man said ""a very good offer, but no thank you""Bill was furious, he needed that tractor! So he came back in the middle of the night and stole it and drove it back to his farm.The next morning Bill was awoken by a loud knock at the door. He was greeted by 3 policemen standing with the owner of the golden tractor. Bill was sent to court and sentenced to 3 years in prison for the theft of the tractor and had his whole tractor collection taken away from him.While in prison Bill had major withdrawal symptoms from his tractors, but as time went on, he learned to live without them. After 3 years he was released and he decided to go to his local pub. The bartender was complaining that it was too hot in the pub. Bill told the bartender that he could help him with his problem.

"Brass tacks:A dear friend went radio silence a couple weeks ago. She'd been struggling with PTSD since she was raped a year or two ago, and the court hearing last weekend didn't go well. A mutual friend and I planned to visit her this weekend. She told our friend that she was on a plane, going cross country, on credit. Admittedly suicidal. ""Sorry for being a wretched friend"".She told me a few times never to stop reaching out, but she may be extremely distrustful of men right now. Our sole mutual friend is in a dark place, herself, and can't safely talk to her.I'm coping with the possibilities as calmly as I can - not my first rodeo - but I don't know what else to do other than text a few kind words every one or two days. She replied with a single heart last Tuesday, otherwise a lack of feedback, justified distrust (in men), and her chronic guilt of being a ""bad friend"" is making it difficult to choose the right words.I'll be calling a suicide hotline tonight for advice. Anything else in the meantime?Edit: I just clued in that the trip might be a lie and she could be gone. Will continue as if it's true.",1

"Brief background on me: I'm 15 this year, and suffer from depression. I have a dark history with 'family and friends' and I'm not sure what to do anymore. Life's been a bitch to me, my studies have gone haywire, I'm losing friends and I think too much about murder and suicide. I feel that suicide while bringing someone down with me is my only way out. Help.If it helps, I live life without a care anymore. Since life is a bitch to me, might as well don't give it any more chances.Edit: Since i have nothing to lose, might as well leave my life story here.I was a very well behaved kid from age 1-6. Then it all changed. My most beloved grandmother passed, and my mother, with no parenting experience took over after quitting her job. From Primary 1-6 (7-12), it wasn't fun. I was beaten and kicked out of the house for even just a small mistake. Back then my studies were fairly decent, averaging As on my tests. Bullying was a major problem, being shoved around, called names, hurt physically and emotionally. Seconday School rolls along. I'm fucked, I can't keep up in school, I'm simply starting to be ostracized. I feel helpless. Now I'm Secondary 3(15), today I'm accused of being a stalker, I'm getting blocked, and time is running out. My murderous mind is going crazy, I nearly leapt today. Close friend stopped me. One day I'm gonna be outta friends. That is when I know I'm a definite goner. Please. Help me for god's sake.",1

"But it's a little difficult to escape from what's in your own head. I wish I could just kill myself. I want to so badly. I think about it all the time. It feels like the only means of escape.Everything in life is just so filled with pain. I seem to be constantly afflicted with some sort of psychological torment or another. Everything hurts in some way. There's just this constant black pit of negative emotion eating at me from the inside. I can't take it. It eats away at my soul. I don't even know who I am anymore, if I ever did. There's just depression and everything that comes along with it.I just want to escape from it. I want it gone. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I just want everything to be okay for once.It's been so long though. So very, very long. My mental illnesses began when I was around 11 or 12 years old. I'm 25 now. Along the way depression sort of became a part of who I am. Part of my identity.It eats away at my soul, then takes it's place.I hate it.I hate the emotional pain and mental agony. I hate the constant stress and anxiety. I hate the terror and despair. I hate being so useless, so worthless. I hate being unable to live my life due to the sickness that has permeated the very core of my being.I want it all gone. I just want to be okay. It's so hopeless.I've tried so much. No-one can help me, and I can't help myself. I seem to be utterly incapable of it, no matter what I do, or how hard I try. I just can't do it. It feels like my pain has become such an integral part of me that no matter what I or anyone else does I cannot separate from it.I can't escape it.Not unless I kill myself. It's the only option available. The only escape I can have.I wish I could do it. I'm so tired of feeling this way. I can't take it. I'm so weak.I just want to escape.",0

"Cross-posted from  where it was deleted to avoid harmful trollsI've always had self esteem issues due to my abusive family and repeated school failures. I am feeling super inferior to everybody in general and I'm very anxious. Anyway, I've been with my boyfriend for a bit less than a year now. He's absolutely amazing on every aspect, he's the most caring I ever knew. He accepts all of my insecurities, listens to my worries and always does his best to reassure me, a real treasure. Besides that, he's confident, attractive, extrovert, popular, and a very talented musician - basically he has all the qualities I desire. I'm 4 years late in my studies, have no talent, suffer from anxiety and body image issues,... Many things that he never worries about. Every time he displays his musical or social talent, instead of feeling inspired by him, I get super jealous. I'm convinced that he's what I'm supposed to become and that I never will because I suck at everything and I'm a failure. Now I've reached a point where I can't even stand hanging out with him because I immediately start comparing him to me and it makes me feel suicidal. I feel like I'm never gonna be as good as him and that I should erase myself because I'm gonna be a failure forever. I know my behavior is unhealthy but I'm unable to see my boyfriend as my equal and it makes me more and more depressed each time. Please help, I don't know what to do.

"Denial, rejection and my bad life situation plus extreme depressions and a broken, offended heart. Would have started therapy in 4 days, but then i realized in most cases it doesnt help and if, then it takes years. I have no zero motivation left and i just cant take it anymore. No one to talk to, alone since 7 years. Not even a damn hug ive gotten from anyone, because im unable to talk to people and to go outside anyway. I did my best to make it that long. There is no more hope. Im over the edge. All bad emotions at once. Im crying at least 1 hour every night. Im so done. No one can help me and the only person i ever loved rejected me. I hate myself. Its too much.",1
"Depression. Anxiety. Being alone. Not truly being needed by anyone here. It sucks. It hurts. No one needs me here. I'm just here for the sole purpose of existing. No one would care or notice if I disappeared tonight. No one bothers to ask me how I'm doing today. No one stops to ask me if I'm doing okay. Everyone has a group of friends who love them endlessly and actually want to see them outside of school and talk to them and everything. I'm just a background decoration in everyone's lives and all I need is to just be validated. All I ever wanted was... to feel wanted. This life is literal hell. It's my personal hell. I'd rather be anywhere but here. I'd rather be anyone else but me. I don't want this body. I don't want this life. Maybe if I go, people will notice. No one fucking talks to me unless they need me to listen to their problems and GOD I WANT TO HELP BUT IT SUCKS THAT I'M JUST A PERSONAL THERAPIST TO EVERYONE. JUST ONCE, I'D LIKE SOMEONE TO TEXT ME LIKE ""Hey ----, how are you feeling today?"" or a message like ""You matter to me and I need you here."" No one fucking cares. People say they do but no one fucking listens to me when I text them asking for help. My insides are crying ""save me now."" Fuck this life. Fuck this world. I don't want to be me. I feel so fucking alone. I'm so sick of waking up every single day and wishing I didn't. I am sick of crying so much. I can't fucking stand being such an outcast. All I ever fucking wanted was to fit in. I hate myself more than words could ever fucking describe and I just want to blow my face to goddamn bits with a shotgun. I feel so goddamn bad that you have to read this shit because it's not easy to hear these kind of words. I hate that I care about everyone so goddamn much. I wish I could stop. When everyone else wakes up, their nightmares end. Mine never does. Everyday I pray that I'll wake up from this dream and be a happy, beautiful child who is loved by everyone. This mental illness is tearing me up right in front of everyone's eyes and no one cares. I talk about killing myself a lot. And I bet if I were to be in the middle of killing myself, no one would stop me. I've been depressed since I was a child. Wanna know what fucking sucks about teen depression? While everyone is living the best years of their life by going to parties, making awesome memories, falling in love, and so on... I'm not. I'm wishing my own fucking life away. I'm scared that I'll just be thrown into a hospital again and be put on meds that just make me feel so damn numb. I am so ready to go. I don't want to be here anymore. Everyday is a battle with myself. It's like going to war with the enemy... and each battle ends in your bitter defeat. But you still show up on the battle field every day even though you know you're going to get your ass kicked. Each day, the wounds become deeper and more severe. You grow weaker and weaker. And then one day, you wave a white flag and it's over. Or the enemy finally kills you. Either way, you will lose to your demons. I have accepted the fact that my demons will win. And fuck, maybe they already have. I'm tired of fighting. ",1

"Does anyone else have obsessive suicidal thoughts even when they aren't depressed? Oh I've had plenty of suicidal ideation while depressed, and I know that lovely fantasy of the escape of death very very well, but this is different.My obsessive suicidal thoughts are part of my pure-O OCD. Sometimes I'm not even depressed. It's like another person is living in my head screaming at me to kill myself and I can't stick up for myself and tell them I don't want to. I'm not hearing a voice, it's my own internal dialogue. It's overwhelming, continuous and extremely distressing. I get graphic visuals of me killing myself. And to clarify this happens when I'm not depressed and is not ideation. It's impossible to live with. It's at times where I don't even hate myself like I have when I'm depressed. Like I'm trying to go about my life but the girl inside my head screaming at me to kill myself cannot be quieted. That's when I start thinking of needing to do something like drugs or suicide just to get away from my obsessive thoughts. I don't really have a question, just putting myself out there I guess on a sleepless obsessive night. TL;DR I have suicidal obsessive thoughts that aren't ideation that haunt me",1

"Earlier this year I discovered smoking pot makes me not suicidal. I tried therapy and medication for years but all it ever did was make me even more anxious and depressed. Pot is so much cheaper and helps get me through the day. I don't even smoke daily, I'd say maybe 5 times in a 2 week period. It helps keep me happier, lets me function at work better, and it's pretty awesome cleaning the house and cooking healthy food while stoned.Except I've had a bad cold/sinus issue for a month now. I don't have health insurance or money for a doctor. Even if I did, doctors give me such bad anxiety I become suicidal just thinking about having to go to one. (Same reason I avoid therapists, my phobia is pretty bad.) I haven't been able to smoke while I've been sick, it really bothers my sinuses. That, plus the doctor anxiety, means I'm ready to go through all of my craft supplies to find something to hang myself with.I just want to not be sick anymore. I can't afford this. I already have issues due to all the abuse I went through as a kid, and how my finances are in the toilet. If I can't forget my problems for awhile, then I want out of this life. This world we live in is quickly going to collapse, anyway. With the economy, environment, and so on.",1
"Early 30s female here, quietly gearing up to end things in the somewhat near future.  Possibly.  Probably.  Kind of at the stage where I'm amping myself up for it, mentally preparing and forming preliminary plans.  Honestly, it could be several months away if I can endure that long.  Getting through each day has gotten very hard though.  I truly want an outcome where I can live, but the constant discomfort I feel makes me think euthanasia has to be on the table, at least as a consideration.  Just wanted to vent, maybe find some like-minded friends grappling with their own stuff.  I don't have the typical reasons I think most people have for doing this.  I have high self-esteem and feel good about myself, I feel I am attractive, intelligent, talented.  For most of my life I have been pretty resilient in the face of challenges, of which I've had many.  I have tons of interests in life and goals.  I loved being alive before this happened... eating, music, writing, art, animals, being around people...all that life entails.  I'm a very empathic, kind person, which hopefully doesn't sound arrogant to say, but I do feel like I have a lot of good to contribute to this world.  I have a fairly rewarding and intriguing job where I work with some less fortunate people.  I am a little isolated in my personal life, but I have a couple of close relationships that keep me going.  My point is that other than this, I had reasons to live.If my suicide occurs, it will be 100% because I could not cope with the way I was injured or the ensuing pain.  I literally don't have any other reason in my life that would cause me to take such drastic action right now.  I can live with being poor, I can live with isolation, I can live with a lot of things.  But I can't accept never being physically comfortable again.  Not like this.     Burning facial and dental pain is a constant reminder of the senseless mistakes that I've suffered through, and it's driven me insane.  Aggressive and unnessary dental work with an incompetent, money grubbing dentist followed by miscommunications with another ended up completely botching my teeth, ending with someone deeply shaving into them to adjust my bite when I didn't consent to such measures. This caused me massive pain and bite problems way worse than the minor complaints I went in with.  It's a long story, but I basically started out with zero problems and went on this insane ride that ended in me being so botched and traumatized.  Just a perfect storm of terrible luck.  I was subject to unnecessary procedures, then to correct those, I was subject to another invasive one that was the final nail in the coffin.  I basically got scammed into work I didn't want, leaving me with exposed nerves, worn back teeth, a constant burning in my teeth and face, and a newfound death wish if this is what my life is to be.  I'm looking at suing the more recent of the two dentists who did the most devastating work, but these cases are really hard to fight.  The crux of my case is that I had actually asked this dentist in our consult for the opposite of what was done and did not consent to what actually happened.  He was supposed to build some slightly worn teeth back up as we discussed in our consult, but decided on his own to adjust my bite using a reductive approach instead, destroying healthy dentition by reshaping my teeth with a power tool when I came to our next appointment.  I've later learned this procedure is actually very controversial and has caused other people a lot of problems, too.  It's barbaric and probably will go the way of mercury fillings and be phased out of dentistry in the next decade or two, some bite specialists already refuse to do it anymore but they are very rare.  It's called an occlusal equilibration.  The fact that I had this inflicted on me makes me feel so violated.  I never, ever would have agreed to what was done to me had it been discussed beforehand, and it's just left me in horrendous anguish.  Imagine if you went in for one procedure you had discussed with someone but received the opposite that you didn't need, how insane that would make you.  Especially when you have complications and find it's surprisingly difficult and expensive to fix.  I went from being a normal, basically healthy young woman to needing major prosthetic work done on all my back teeth so fast, thanks to the handiwork of these charlatans.  It hurts so much all the time.  I don't know if I can live in this marred body anymore, even if the rest of it is still in good shape, this is too destructive and painful to heal from.  Now I'm in this terrifying position of needing advanced dentistry to restore my quality of life.  Nothing else is going to address the pain.  Someone has to go in who really knows what they're doing and cover up all of the exposed nerve endings with composite or onlays and hope there wasn't nerve damage.If you knew me, you'd appreciate how ironic this is...I battled depression when I was much younger, and actually beat it for many years.  I formed an outlook that kept me very content in life.  A strong foundation.  No matter what happened to me I was good, because I felt good, I was healthy, I felt good inside my own skin, I could endure any challenges.  I chose to be happy and not to suffer.  This worked for many years, the positive mindset I developed for myself.  It would've lasted a lifetime I think, were it not for this one crazy thing.  This is like the one thing in the whole world that could have taken me to this place.  In an extremely unlucky series of events, I was injured by a medical professional, and this injury torments me...the way it transpired, how it feels, how profoundly unlucky I am.  How difficult it will be to repair the damage, if that's even possible.  I should have stopped it, I shouldn't have blindly trusted... I realize now how my previous happiness deeply hinged on my health and physical comfort.  I may never feel normal or ok inside my body again.  I have not been comfortable for several years.  There is a constant burning at the site of the injury that does not let up.  My face is always uncomfortable because my bite is so messed up.  I appear aesthetically normal to others since most of the work was on back teeth,  but I'm in immense pain.  Nothing will ever heal without major intervention.  I just don't think I can accept this life anymore.I wish there was a way I could live, but my mind just won't accept the new reality I am living in.  I'm constantly uncomfortable.  I'm trying to give myself that couple of months, but it's really hard.  Every day is heartbreaking because this is not supposed to be my life.  This is a travesty.  So rare and unlucky, who goes through this?  Now the plan is to travel many states away to see an experienced specialist for my issues.  I'm trying to stay alive to see this through...the specialist seems pretty optimistic about fixing this.  But it is a process that will take several months of costly back and forth travel and procedures.  It will be my last stab at life.  I'm just so devastated, some days I don't even know if I can hold out that long.  What happened, how this all started...it's too unfair to process.  I was recently diagnosed with PTSD as a result of this incident.Is there anyone else on here in their 30s and at their end?  Or anyone else who has a medical/dental issue or mistake that became suicide fuel for them?I don't know how to end my rant...pain is a bitch.  But it's even worse when it you can't stop looking back, knowing it shouldn't have happened, knowing it was so preventable and senseless and just pure bad luck.  Something about this sensation I just cannot take.  It feels so horrible.  I can handle other types of injuries and pain but this is apparently my Achilles heel.  I would trade this in for almost anything else.  I'm not strong enough to deal with this.",1

"EDIT ....I know that everyone else has difficulties and maybe this kind of hardship feels too close to home to some but please, try not to just post 'This is so like me' becuase it is not helping at all'A few days ago I turned 24 but I was not excited to celebrate my birthday. In fact, I was horrified and even embarassed.This started to happen when I was around age 22-23 but I was already feeling like I was too late in life. Like I was too late to have my shot to be able to have a good future in my life.I know that everyone goes through tough situations in their lives and everyone makes mistakes and have to go through obstacles.Basically, shit happens to everyone. A lot and most of them come unexpected.But I felt like this ever since I was a teenager - even though the world is very vast and has lots of things going on with lots of things happeneing at once, it is very impatient and wants things to be done There are so many things going on and to catch up with everything is a nightmare and the world is changing incredibly and it is a lot of pressure on the competitive nature of the capitalistic world we live in.I really wished that I had a grip in my life much earlier but I was a kid before - I was an idiot with no clear goal and well ... shit happened. Bullies, abuse and so much more and in the end, it scarred me and it scarred me for so many years that only now I wanted to take charge and actually do something about it but every day, I keep blaming myself for allowing these things to happen to me  that I allowed myself to be such a weakling and make myself into a shadow of my own self and be a pussy instead of actualyl grabbing my own nuts like other people do and keep going and move on.But I was pushed back in a way and I felt stuck for many years.I did manage to eventually try to push myself to keep going back on track but half of my attention is always concerning that I started to get a grip on my own life too late so I feel that I am mostly battling against my own guilt and shame and embarassed that I am too late and should already just give up Everyday, I keep making comparisons with everyone and often see everyone better than me. Better grades, better income, better lives, better possible futures, more happiness, more confidence and so much more I feel like i am stuck in both my past and my future, afraid of both sides and afraid and confused on what to do. Stuck because I feel like I have a lot of baggage about my past self and looking deep into myself to look into my own shattered soul is a fucking nightmare and a job that will take forever and incredibly painful.On the other hand, I am afraid of the future. I keep making countless and countless possible calculations and preparations for the worst like what if this guy is better than me. Should I study harder? What if I will not pass this test? Should I apply for a job already?It's extremely infuriating and scary especially when you own soul feels broken and your mind against you and criticizing your every move *(it's trying to push yourself while trying to fix yourself at the same time while trying to battle against countless waves of enemies like the demons of the entire hell are after you)(Honestly, I am 24 and I am still at university doing my bachelor degree. There are those days where I feel very embarrassed that I haven't graduated yet while people younger than me already did. And I know that I have made many mistakes in my life and the shame and the guilt is very strong and very deep everyday but the worst part is that I have a poor habit of ruminating about those mistakes and unable to forgive myself or tackle it to make sure that I have the right strategy to tackle it if I ever happen to make that mistake again or avoid doing it.Most of the time when I make a mistake, I go into a dark spiral of shame and guilt and sheer self-criticism and I end up in a cycle of criticism and doing those mistakes again and feel even worse in the process.Sometimes I even ruminate about my ruminating habit as well which makes the burden and guilt much worse and this habit has been happening for years and affected how I look at myself and affected how I work and how I think during my studies How can I break this habit? What strategies I can use to help myself from going deeper into the cycle of depression, anxiety and EXTREME self-hatred and self-loathing and suicidal thoughts?How can I really and truly stop being afraid of the future and stop criticising myself for pretty much anything because I feel like I am at the bottom of the food chain and I feel like I have no chance to survive in life?Honestly, I often feel that I should just grab a gun and shoot myself and save all the trouble from trying to push myself when it will be all for nothing and avoid all the humiliation and embarassed. Many people have already managed to achieve a lot in life and I feel that I was left behind and I feel that maybe I should just give up. I cannot risk experiencing further humiliation than I already have ",1

I've been institutionalize for suicide as a teen because my significant other preformed fellatio to a friend in front of me but ive never tried again ever since. I have a ton of friends and  I always put a smile upon them and it makes me happy. It truly does. But I'm depressed and sometimes can't stop to think to dissappear. No one's really reached out to me except one girlfriend. But she overdosed on heroin so she's out of the picture. I have a gf now but every time I tell her about something she has little to say or doesn't know what to say. She makes me laugh and all but doesn't get me truly.

"Edit: i'm asking this because, recently, a woman has been talking to me during lunch. i usually sit alone against a wall, but this is out of preference so i can get some semi-alone time during the day. Anyways, she doesn't go to my school (high school) and wears a ""visitor"" sticker. i believe she's finished school. she first approached me out of nowhere, asked to sit with me, and then began asking questions about my life (siblings, hobbies, pets, etc.) she's always smiling and happy and thinks everything i do is interesting in one way or another. at first i thought she was just a friendly visitor with some free time, but as the days of her visiting grew, i became suspicious. after three or four times we've talked, she asked for my number she doesn't show up every day and she has other people she talks with as well. have i been placed on some sort of watchlist, and she's a volunteer who talks to me to distract me from bad thoughts/suicide, or is she just a friendly person i met through odd circumstances? I'm also a female, so i doubt she's trying to flirt with me and if she is, then it's not going to get her anywhere considering i'm not a lesbian ",1

Ever since I was born my mom would always physically abuse me but as I got older it was more emotional and I can't do anything about it but its really hurting me and just making me want to go onto things like drugs or even her alcohol. I think about how much it would be better if I died but I have some people in my life who actually care and I wouldn't imagine losing them. A lot of people also take advantage of me because of my looks but then always go behind my back and I can't take it anymore...,1
Every day is torture. I've been dealing with gender dysphoria for most of my life and it's gotten to the point where it feels like nothing will ever get better. I'll never be able to live my life to the fullest. I just want to die so I don't have to suffer anymore. Whenever I try to talk to my family or school counselor about this they just call me selfish and never offer any help. I can't even kill myself because I'm under 18 and can't buy any drugs or weapons. I'm going to be stuck in this miserable spiral forever.,0
Every day just brings me closer to the death,1
"Every day suicidal thoughts get more intense. I can't stand the shame of being so inferior and weak all the time. This is very painful as I'm sure society looks down on young men who are like this.

They are more intelligent, getting better educations, more sociable, successful and generally better human beings. How can I possibly compete in society? ",1
"Every hour of everyday I wish I was dead. I have multiple ways to end my life at my disposal, but I can't use them. My death would destroy my family, mainly my younger brother and sister. If it wasn't for them I would have been gone long ago. Its such a burden to carry I can hardly take it. My friends think I hate them because I've isolated myself. My grades are shit and it's my senior year of college. Im tired of therapy and different meds. It makes no difference. But I feel like I have to carry this burden... so that others can continue to live the normal lives that I'll never have.",1

"Everyday hurts, and I just don't want to be alive anymore. There's no point to it. I can picture things getting better all I want, but at the end of the day, what's it matter if ""things get better""? I'm only prolonging what will inevitably happen anyway. What if I just don't want to live. I don't want to ""try"" anymore. I don't  if it's possible that things will change. I just want life to be over . I can't do this anymore, I just can't stand waking up, breathing, living. I don't want it. I can't do this. I just need the courage to go through with it. That's all that's holding me back, not some ""you don't really want to die"" bs. I'm just a coward. But I think hanging myself would be the best choice. I just have to kick the chair from under me, then there's no turning back, no matter how scared I get. And I can do that. I can do that. That'd be the only thing I could do. I'm just so tired. I have no one to talk to, no one who would care, and being constantly isolated was bound to take its tole anyway. My death wouldn't be a surprise to anyone and no one would notice if I were gone--or well, my parents might notice, since those are the only people that I see everyday. But I'm such a burden, that it would probably make their lives easier. I just want everything to stop. I've been taking sleeping pills randomly because I can't stand being conscious. And I just want to sleep permanently. Sorry for rambling.I'm just here to vent a little, so someone could know I was here, if only for a little while. ",1

Everyday my life gets worse.,1
Everyday of my life,1
"Everyday when i'm trying to sleep i hope to not wake up, it would be perfect.
I just can't understand so many things that it drives me crazy. I have a great family i love them, i am smarter than most, i'm healthy (at least my body is), but i can't do anything. I stared 2 colleges but could not finish either one, i'm 24 but in all my life I worked for 4 months.
Live today is just waiting for death to come, i'm doing treatment and taking my medicine for 2 years already and still think the same way, I'm not in a hurry to die, but I know that I'm on a cliff, the only thing holding me is the love for my family, I don't want to taint them with a son who killed himself I don't want my mom to suffer, but that's it and to live a life where the only thing I need to do is go to therapy twice a week I may be enough, but to live a life where I have to suffer everyday fighting against my own head to do things that's absolute natural to others is not even close to being enough.
It's scary to say that to someone that knows me or knew me, they always feel that my problems is not problems at all, that everything I'm going through is normal for everybody and even me thinks that way sometimes.
I can't understand how and why some people have the energy to wake up everyday and go to work at something they don't like. I know the answer most of times, they need the money to survive, but what would make me leave my house? Survival is not important to me.
I never had plans, never in my whole life I earned money and thought ""oh, now I can do that shit that I really wanted to do"". What happened was that I months after earning that I searched for a way to use it that would not be a waste.
The last time that I had sex was 8 years ago, the last time I kissed a girl was 6 years ago. Now the only thing I feel when I see someone attractive is anger, anger for still feeling attracted to them, everytime I catch my self looking at a girl I go mad, I want to go blind, everytime I have to interact with someone beautiful I feel bad, first I get anxious then I get mad at myself.
One year and something ago I download tinder, it was my last try at getting to know someone new, even just friends, but I found out that I have nothing to offer, why would someone go out with me? And found that I can't make new friends, I'm to scared to meet them, I'm too anxious to talk to them, receiving a message just make me feel bad, I don't have anything to offer and if I don't control myself I start to lie and it helps at the time but it turns everything worst at the future, it's like I have to study before every conversation so I don't say something stupid.
It looks so easy for almost everybody and I suffer so much to do it, I just want to turn me off in a way that I'll not hurt my parents, but even this is hard for me. ",1

I have nothing to back up my feelings, i can't complain to anyone. My family is far from the emotional type so i don't feel within an inch comfortable of talking to them. I fucking hate everyone.

I dropped out of school, i'm going to uni but i don't care for any of it. I have zero motivation to care or change myself, or want better. I want out. But i don't think i'd be able to kill myself, i know there are some people that care about me, and i don't really want to. But i don't want to live in this introverted warped perspective of life i see as hell. I'm so angry. My thoughts don't represent my actions.

Ex keeps trying to prevent my death,1
"Exactly 2 years ago my girlfriend and I got 5 kittens from the street. They were all very sick but we nursed them back to health and found homes for 3 of them.We kept 2 of them and they became inseparable along with my girlfriend's cat. Dexter was bigger than the other cats since little and therefore no one wanted him. But he grew up to be the sweetest cat I've ever had.He was 15 lbs and never ever scratched us. He would always sleep next to my girlfriend and was just an overall sweet gentle big cat.The thing is, he would sometimes breathe weirdly and we didn't pay much attention to it. 4 days ago he became very ill and we took him to the vet right away. Apparently there was some sort of weird bacteria growing close to his lungs and heart.Now I don't think this is what killed him, both my girlfriend and I think he was too stressed and the vet didn't wait long enough for him to calm down before putting a syringe in him to take the liquid out. In the end he died right on my hands even though they had told us less than 5 mins prior that he would be okay to be taken to a 24 Hour emergency vet. He died of stress in my hands and I can't get the image out.I can't help but feel like I failed an innocent creature whose life depended on me. I lost one of my best friend's in a car accident in which I was driving in 2011 (guy crashed into us) and this brings back memories. I can't help but feel like I keep messing up at life. That little cat was a beautiful creature and I know this might all sound dramatic to some of you.But I just feel like such a failure.",1

First time having suicidal thoughts,1
"First time posting. Life has hit a dead end, and honestly I'm disappointed with myself and everything. I feel like everything and everyone that once made me happy are fading. Soon I'll be an unfeeling husk. I Don't want that. I'd rather die than exist without any feeling or meaning. I'm just...teetering on the edge",0
"Firstly, If you are thinking of sending help' please don't. As much as I admire you're noble intentions; it's much too late for me. I've tried getting help it's not meant to be as the mental health services as has my doctor have concluded that I'm not unwell enough based on my past achievement's.
Also, I've not decided to end my life right away but rather I'll do it after I've tied up a few loose ends.I have been doing my research and my conclusion is that for me, this will be best for me.
I'm autistic. I lost both my parents, I was an only child and therefore I no longer have any family. I was a full time carer for my mother for 15 years. She was disabled and very sick but my efforts to save her failed. I completed my duties as her carer and her son. But these past two years living for myself brings me no purpose, no happiness, no hope. Just loneliness and a new-found drug addiction that brings me some comfort and pleasure in my lost existence.Due to my aforementioned autism, I have difficulty forming relationships (as if being gay wasn't difficult enough). People I do meet after talking to them online like the sound of me but don't actually like me in person and so don't give me a chance. I'm in my early thirties and I've never been in a relationship that has made me happy; including friendships.
I'm also living with the effects of abuse; I'm no longer being abused however I find myself ruminating about the past and have never truly healed from it.Rather than suicide, I see this as an act of euthanasia.
The first time I tried to accomplish this task, it resulted in me laying unconscious for a few days in my house that I lived alone in.
It may not be a natural death, but to me it feels natural. Either existence ceases or I'll be reunited with all the loved ones I lost; and we can be a family again. But one things for sure; this is the end of my existence that I fought to exist in to the point of exhaustion.I don't know why I'm posting this. I suppose just so there's a record of my thoughts out there somewhere.Thank you for reading.",0

Foolproof my suicide for me.,1
"For a bit of background, a lot has happened to me recently and this isn't the first time I've felt suicidal. I've been quite depressed for the past year and a half- at one point, around 6 months ago, I started writing letters to friends and family in preparation though I suspect it was mostly cathartic. I'm not sure. I will also note that three years ago I had a drug overdose that I believe was a suicide attempt, but I am not quite sure. I was sort of in auto-pilot that day. At the moment, I'm finishing my degree, moving out, am seeing a psychiatric who believes I have bipolar disorder and struggling with general feelings of sensitivity and self-hate. I'm crying almost every day. I truly believe that the people around me are sick of me and/or hate me but feel obliged to stick around. The heightened sensitivity has been the hardest hurdle as a small incident can make me withdraw completely for days on end. For instance, around a week ago my friend and roommate had invited me to see other friends, but I had a prior commitment. He said he had decided to go later and I said 'I might come too then' and he ignored the statement and planned around me. I literally cried about this for days and thought that he must hate me and must not want to be around me because I'm probably a buzzkill or he's tired of me, and he probably doesn't care at all if he didn't even try to give an excuse or anything. This is an example of the small occurrences that have been setting me off and forcing me to reflect on my own lack of self-esteem.I don't want to be around myself either but I don't have a choice. I'm scared of finishing my degree because I think I might want to do masters but my parents will be so ashamed. I'm scared of staying with my aunt if I don't find a new place to live soon enough, and my lease is up in two weeks. I'm scared of getting diagnosed with bipolar. I'm scared of losing everyone in my life. I'm just so tired and I want to sleep all of the time, I don't have the capability to get through the next month. I wish I could pause time and find a hotel room so I could just sleep and cry alone for half a year. I really don't know what to do. I'm struggling to live minute to minute. ",1

I'm clingy, irritating, and never happy. And now I'm alone. My grandpa passed away a couple weeks ago, my dad is in the hospital, my mom lost her job, and my grandma has stage 4 cancer. School just started and I didn't make the soccer team. I just see no reason to keep living right now. Nothing's gonna get better, it hasn't for the last 14 years. I feel so alone right now and don't even know what to do. If anybody actually cared about me enough to read here, thank you.",1

I'm supposed to be a senior in college this year, but I got expelled this past year because I didn't care enough to go to any of my classes. To pay my bills now, I work full time on 3rd shift and I hate my job. To stay awake on the job, I take caffeine pills and they give me really bad anxiety.

"For the past month I've been staying with my partner, and I just got back home today. We've been together for over two years now, and we're long distance. We visit each other three times a year or so but it never feels like enough.I've been struggling with chronic suicidality for almost as long as I've known my partner. When we're together I rarely even get depressed, but now I'm back home and I've been home for less than 12 hours and I feel suicidal again already. I spoke with my partner about moving in with him, but he's in the US and I'm in Canada, and the only way for us to legally move in with each other is for us to get married, which is something he says he's not comfortable with and he doesn't think he ever will be. He doesn't want to break up, and wants us to be together, but he says that maybe we might have to just be long distance because he doesn't think he'll ever be okay getting married. I don't want to get too into it, because I really feel like I need help quickly and don't feel like I have much time. I don't see a point in living if we're going to be apart like this forever. There's so much I'll miss out on, and I get so depressed being here. I don't see a way out. I feel very urgently like I want to kill myself. Please help me somehow. ",1
"For the past several years I've been depressed. Not majorly depressed though, I'd have moments of happiness. But even in the moments where I would be laughing and enjoying myself, there was always the subtle weight of depression hanging over my head. As the years went on, that feeling just kept getting stronger and stronger. I've dealt with suicidal thoughts in the past, but they were always just thoughts - I always knew I would never actually do it. But in the past few weeks these suicidal thoughts have been much louder and they're starting to sound more and more rational. I've always been quiet and introverted; I don't like talking to the people in my life about anything serious. I just hide my depression behind thick layers of ironic humor and it's fucked me up over the years. I'm completely lost and suicide sounds so fucking relaxing now. Knowing that I could just end all my problems and suffering so easily is such a comforting thought. I'm a junior in university, just transferred here from a community college. I've never known how to make friends. Now I'm living on campus with a bunch of people I don't know, not talking to anyone, not going out, not meeting new people. I'm a business major so there's a lot of pressure to be active in activities and get experience to add to my resume so I can get an internship and look attractive to employers. But I can't do any of that. My social anxiety is so fucking strong, how the hell am I supposed to get through life if I can't even do simple shit like talking to people? Life is supposed to be a healthy mix of doing things you enjoy and doing things you don't enjoy; I know it's not rational for a person to be happy all the time, enjoying every moment they're in. But for me, especially lately, there are seldom moments where I find I'm happy. The majority of my time is spent doing things I don't want to do. I don't find joy in anything anymore. Nothing excites me, nothing can motivate me, I feel so disconnected from other people. Everything is so dull. Even the things that I used to really enjoy, like sex for example, is just so bland. Sex used to be the one thing that I had that I really enjoyed. I used it to cope with my depression for the longest time. But now that's turned dull, just like everything else. If I don't find anything enjoyable anymore then what's the point? I genuinely cannot think of a reason to not kill myself. There's no reward in life anymore, why would I stick around? It's all just fucking shit and dealing with sadness and discomfort and anxiety all the time. I so badly want to just not exist. I don't know why I'm writing this. I've never talked to anyone about any of this because I don't know how to ask for help. I guess I'm just hoping someone can convince me that life is worth living, because I'm getting scared at how enticing suicide is becoming. ",1

"'Forget everything you learned in college. You won't need it working here.''But I never went to college.''Well then, I'm sorry. You are underqualified to work here.'",0
"Forgive my rambling.My name is Ethan. I'm a 17 year old high school senior. I'm told I'm smart and attractive. My parents are married and have money, and I live in the ""free-est"" country on earth. I'm popular at school, within the right circles. I'm the drum major of the marching band. A member of every honor society, a straight A student, and enrolled in college as a high school senior because my school ran out of classes to give me. I spend 2 hours every Monday volunteering at the local co-op, and use my position on the local city's student government to learn about and connect with people in need, and spend many, many hours at school after hours doing tutoring and mentoring. I have a relatively well-paying job, too; $10 an hour, doing vet tech work at an animal hospital.But it's not enough, and will never be enough. Not for my teachers, not for my parents, not for my friends. I am overcommitted, to say the least; it's 1:00 AM, and I've got an AP Stat test in 6 hours that I haven't studied for nearly enough. My college class overlaps the period almost entirely, so I'm only in class for the first half an hour of the 90 minute block. My school advisors and counselors told me not to take the class, and now are telling me to drop it, but my mother won't have it. My schedule is ""not rigorous enough without it"". Forget my 8-credit surplus above graduation requirements and total 13 AP credits I'll have if I make it through the year, plus the 6 extracurriculars and 4 community organizations I either lead or am an active member of-- I need the Stat class, on top of AP Gov/Macro/Micro and AP Physics C:Emag, Linear Alg & Multivar calc, all of which have at least 2 hours homework on top of required textbook reading... It's wearing me down, driving me insane. On days like today, I turn up the good vibes music and try to forget, just to put one foot in front of the other. Just to churn through what needs to happen.I'm miserable, and losing sight of what matters. My ex, my one and only real girlfriend, and I had a nasty breakup in late May. It was really rough on me, but I thought I could make it out with my head held high. I've struck out 4 times since then. They always seem so eager, and then when they really get to know me they back off. It's hard not to take it personally. Sure, maybe we two just weren't compatible, but over and over? And with people I had spent plenty of time getting to know first. It's like people are fine with the mask I wear, but when I let my guard down and start talking about my demons, they excuse themselves.And I'm not even really that fucked up, as far as demons go. Just a crippling caffeine and video game addiction; I take a 200mg caffeine pill in the morning when I wake up, with lunch, and before I sit down to do homework. But I struggle to get motivated, even with the caffeine. It's so easy to come home and sit down at the desk to work, but see the battle.net launcher or steam pop up and tempt me with Overwatch, Terraria, or Stardew, my current weaknesses. I've put an embarrassing amount of time into my games, and don't feel proud at all of my ""achievements"". The friends I used to play them with have since moved on, and I let them. It's not even just an accessibility thing; if I disable my internet, just a pen, paper, and textbook, I still end up passed out on the floor from exhaustion or staring off into space, wishing I was anywhere else.I get that feeling a lot now. Marching band was fun in the beginning; now it's a slog, and I hate it. I hate the idea of dragging my two-hundred-pound podium up to the field, running back for my gear, and despite doing my very best still being at least 15 minutes late to rehearsal. Today, I was almost 45. As drum major, I'm setting a bad example for the kids I'm supposed to lead. I tell them to practice, and then go home and leave my instrument and gloves untouched. Half of it's that I've got so much other shit to do, and the other half is that I just don't care. I don't care if I'm bad anymore. I've already resigned myself to failure no matter how hard I try. I'm just not good. My instructor has said as much many times. Staring in the mirror knowing you'll never be capable no matter how hard you try fucks you up. Especially when to practice you have to check your reflection to see if your arms are parallel. I see the apathy in my own eyes, and... well, I don't care. I'm miserable, and can't escape for very long. Even the best performances are brought down when I watch the recording and see how bad I look. Friday nights, once my escape from the weekly slog, are now just another formula. I conduct, I rest, I play, I conduct, I rest, I conduct... wash rinse repeat. And it's starting to show. People come and ask if I'm okay. I don't know what to tell them.""I'm alright."" ""I'm fine."" Relatively, I can justify this. I've felt this way for a few months now. It feels normal... and yet, I remember  feeling like this. I remember what it feels like to love myself, and love others... to feel loved. But I exacerbated the situation by isolating myself from all my friends, local and online. I haven't been on Overwatch for real in... fuck, ages. A guilty solo queue game here and there, but not much else. I stopped eating lunch with my friends, preferring to work through lunch on homework so I have less when I get home. I don't have time to hang out on weekends, because I'm either doing school, band, or working. I feel so alone, even in a room of people. I spend so much time alone. And yet, I want to be alone. When I'm with others, I'm reminded of who I'm not. I'm not the Ethan I wish I was, the Ethan I am on the outside. I've spent enough time on this sub and ; I know people will tell me that they're both parts of the whole. Bull shit. Outside Ethan is a carefully constructed lie. The sociopath brewing inside of me recognizes that I'll be socially handicapped if I present anything else, and so I've learned to smile from the eyes despite feeling empty and cold.I also lost religion a couple years ago. I was raised Catholic; my family has drifted toward the megachurch style of christianity, due to both convenience and a slight shift of ideals. Leading up to the transition, I began to question the things I was brought up to believe. When and how did all these miracles happen? Why don't we see miracles today? It seems like they just popped up all the time back then. And how come people back then heard the literal word of god and saw angels and shit, and now all we have is a cobbled-together repeatedly retranslated dusty old book? My arguments to both myself and others have become more sophisticated over time, but suffice it to say-- today I am an atheist, and nobody I've met can convince me otherwise. But I wish so hard that I was a christian. I wish it was easy, that I could give my trust to an all seeing, all caring, all powerful god. I wish I could feel the unconditional love paraded by Jesus's followers. But I can't. I've tried so hard. My personal 'faith' is unshakable, and weighs down on me constantly. I need proof, and I cannot find it anywhere. The thought that life only has the meaning we give it once gave me agency and purpose, and now it fills me with despair. Why do I matter? Why should I try? I am a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure.My grades suck. Mostly because they're indicative of just how many shits I give. I have a 117 in physics. The class average is somewhere around an 75, according to my teacher. Feels kinda good, right? I also have a 56 in English, because I haven't turned in half my work. Ah well. I keep telling myself I'll get around to it when I have time, but I don't. I'm told to excel in every way, and I can't. I'm sacrificing sleep to keep this clusterfuck of a life going. I don't eat enough. I'm 6 feet tall and 135 pounds, all muscle and bone. I'm just not hungry. I want to eat, and I try, I just don't have an appetite. My hands shake constantly because I'm fueled by caffeine and caffeine alone for most of the day. My body is always tired but I force it to keep going, and I'm starting to question why.Why do I bother waking up in the morning? My body isn't getting enough sleep. My mind is cloudy from deprivation. But I know if I don't wake up by 5:40, I'll incur the wrath of my parents for not getting my little brother to school in time. I've always struggled to get to school on time, but this year it actually has consequences for someone other than me. I have school from 7 to 2, band until 6 twice a week, after school activities from 5-8 the other two days, and then I'm busy pretty much all of Friday nights. There's just not enough time in the day for it all. I'm overwhelmed, alone, and feel like while everyone in my life has the best intentions they're tearing me apart. I'm pulled in all different directions, and just want to rest. Man, I just want to take a break. I need to take some time to breath. I can't, though. The last time I did, I accumulated so much undone school work that I'm  allocating time to work on NTI's.I've got the constant weight of personal failure on my back at all times. I've failed myself, my parents, my band, my city, my friends... My parents need a good student, who spends time with the family and contributes to making sure things run smoothly. My band needs a drum major who works hard on and off the field, who comes to practice with a smile on his face and inspires his band to work with the same passion. My city needs a punctual ambassador, who doesn't forget to pick up his goddamn suit on the way home from rehearsal. My friends need someone who can be there for them like they're there for me, who makes time. I'm not that person. I need me to be that person. I need me to be someone I can love. I need me to stop smiling because I have to or my friends won't leave me alone. I need me to stop being a person who lets down and brings down.I hurt myself for the first time the other day. Just to see if I could. And I can. It's empowering. And scary. I'm more scared than ever. I now know I could do it. I'm so scared that one day a straw will break this camel's back and I'll give in to temptation. I've fantasized about it so many times. I am losing hope that there's anything worth living for. I'm starting to feel like a burden on my community, like they'd be better off without me holding them back. I know my death would hurt, but surely not so bad they'd never recover. My parents have 3 other kids that will go on to be even more successful than me. I've already distanced myself emotionally from them, and was never really close with my siblings like they are with each other. I've slowly let snapchat streaks die, and high fives in the hall become nods. Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder if I'd be like a dead cat. Mine died a few years ago; this tremendously fat white and black thing, so loving it broke my heart when he died. Every time I walked in the door and he wasn't there, I'd break into tears. Eventually I got used to sleeping alone, and the pain gradually dulled until I felt more of, ""huh. He used to sleep there. Weird not to see him like always."" I wonder if I'd be like that. That itch in the back of your mind like you feel something's missing, but you can't quite place it so you let it be. An empty seat in a classroom that might have always been empty. A position easily filled by someone just as qualified. A son already enough of a disappointment that you begin to feel grateful you don't have to yell at him to get out of bed, that he's late for school again. You have one less mouth to feed, and one less set of grades to check.I'm so scared of what's next. But I know it would stop the hurting. Even if it's nothing, it's still the bliss I want. I don't want any part of the life I'm living now. I'm like a spectator, a fly on the wall, watching it happen around me. I'm tired of the emptiness, and the pain, and the tears, and the regret. I'm tired of letting down, holding back, inconveniencing. I'm tired of letting myself down. I'm tired of failing. It's too much. And I can't give any of it up. If I do, it's not enough. It's not enough now. It will never be enough. All I can do is everything and then some. But I can't.My life ought to be good. So many stories here are much, much darker than mine. But I still don't see any hope for myself. I literally cannot imagine a future, any one at all, fantasy or otherwise, where I'm happy. I'm not motivated to keep going. I can't justify it any more. I'm miserable, and this ought to be as good as it gets. I have everything. And I have nothing. I feel nothing.I am nothing.",1

"Girlfriend of three years broke up with me last month, I've been staying with my abusive family members since. It's going to take at least three months of me living here before I've saved up enough for my own housing and transportation. I could probably have a gun tomorrow. I've been in therapy for like 7 years, the other day i had a physician tell me i was ""refractory to treatment"" and he refused to become involved in my care. Feeling pretty hopeless. Girlfriend was more or less all i had and my mental illness drove her away. No friends to depend on, family is actively making things worse. I live in a state with abysmal mental health care. I've reached out to all of the major institutions at some point and haven't gotten the help i need.  Once when i was being taken to psychiatric hold i told a paramedic i was ""sorry but I'm not going inpatient in [my state]"" the paramedic responded by grabbing my hand and saying ""i know"". I'm excited to stop struggling. Honestly, not existing sounds more wonderful than any future i can imagine. I want to stop suffering. Being as mentally ill as i am i know I'm not ever going to stop suffering. I'm never going to be gifted the ability emotionally regulate like a normal person. Everyday life events are excruciating, and frankly, the constant emotional pain makes my quality of life indefensible.

"God, I really hate myself for posting this because I have never spoken to anyone about this... whatever, here goes.I'm 16, and my mother has always been rather volatile, with severe mood swings and irrational behaviour at times. She's in a pretty terrible relationship with my father, who has anger issues. My dad isn't deliberately cruel or anything - he just loses control of his temper and to be fair, when she's in one of her moods, she goads him and manipulates him. Unfortunately, both have their issues - and neither can or will leave.She recently tried to kill herself. This isn't anything new, but this is the closest I have ever been to losing her. We found her near dead, lacking vital signs, and she was hospitalized for days. She's back and is better, but its getting harder to prevent her from getting her hands on dangerous substances. Every time I hide something that she can use or has used, she finds something else. I don't know what else I can do, or how I can talk to her. How the hell can I explain to her that what's she doing ? That it won't solve any of her problems? She says that when she's gone I can focus better on school and my dad will be less angry. That's untrue. My dad would be broken. We all would be.She keeps telling me how proud she was of how I handled myself when she was hospitalized. I'm now worried that she will be less bothered about killing herself because now she feels I'm mature and responsible enough to be without her.To compound issues, I'm planning on attending university abroad. I have the marks and the stats to get into some great places, but I'm scared that if I go, she'll get worse and I won't be there to prevent something from happening. I still want to go - call me selfish, but I hate dealing with this and I don't want to put my life on hold because of my parents - but the guilt is getting to me. Is there anything I can do to hopefully help her so when I leave, she won't be as bad? I think I'm asking a bit too much there. Thanks for reading anyways. Cheers and have a nice day :)",1

"Growing up, I got bullied and teased. Ive always been the kid trying to be in the in crowd, trying to look cool, trying to be popular. I tried so hard that my best friend in elementary school doubled as my bully. (She wasn't my only bully) I never physically got it but man were those kids mean. I got bullied literally from 5 years old to college. Everywhere I go... it turns into some form of bullying. At work, my bosses.. or even coworkers. I once got into a physical altercation with my roommate because I wanted her to stop using my as a verbal punching bag.  I was an asshole too so don't feel too sorry for me. I once told my now friend that I heard screams in my head whenever I looked at her hair. I know, what the fuck is wrong with me right? This was like middle school. I bullied this one girl from elementary school to senior year of high school. We are now friends, I sincerely apologized after we graduated and never bullied her again. I am no longer a bully..I grew up my whole life thinking I'd be a rapper and when I got famous I'd say FUCK ALL YOU HOE ASS BULLIES, FUCK YOU!! Or maybe I'd forgive them and just motivate some other kids who got bullied. Idk, I wanted to be an inspiration and change the world. I wanted to be like Kanye West. My favorite rapper of all time. But even Kanye broke my fucking heart..he used to be for the black community and struggles and uplifting black people but all he cares about is money now and clothes and rich people bullshit. Im a fucking virgin. Im overweight. Im a 22 year old virgin and im a girl!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK.. I never even kissed a guy.. other than one time in 8th grade during truth or dare. ..until recently. I was on the train coming home from work and this guy asked if he could kiss me. I guess I looked rougly decent that day. He probably had low standards though bcuz he wasnt that great looking either. Anyway.. dude asks to kiss me and I say why the fuck not because YOLO right? I have NO friends... My phone broke recently and I realized that I didnt even need it because I dont need it... The only person who texts me is me is my younger sister who's 19.. I had a great best friend of 8 years. It would have been 9, but I treated her like utter shit and I touched her in her sleep. What kind of fucking asshole does that to someone??? To make matters worse, she's straight and had no feelings for me whatsoever. We talked about me liking her and her not liking me before I did it. I hate myself straight up. I apologized to my friend many times, she said she's not angry but she doesnt want to be friends anymore. I completely understand but I just hate myself for this shit now.. Its embarrassing, everything. Im tired of this life. I dropped out of college because Im bipolar and have ADD also.. so school is fucking hard and I flunked 5 semesters. I shouldve graduated by now but Im 2 years behind.. maybe more.Ive never been in a relationship.My mom had a talk with me last night and told me that nobody celebrates failure. And she was telling me why people dont like me. This may sound bad, but she was coming from a good place and out of concern, her tone may not translate because of the way Im writing it.",1

"Happened when I was struggling with undiagnosed PTSD from a sexual assault. I got on meds and got therapy and was only in that industry for a couple months. I made one video and I didn't do anything except kiss her, but we were naked. I feel like I was using that and camming to take back control of my body. Now I completely regret it. I feel ashamed and every time this girl (who is still in the business) shares the video on her twitter I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I have tried to reach out as she used to be a very good friend, but she hasn't spoken to me since. I feel so disgusting. I feel hopeless. I know people from our highschool know about her so I'm sure they've seen the video. I honestly just want to kill myself. I am so fucking stupid. ",1

trust me, i know people have it so much worse than i do, but im also not as strong as other people. i think about killing myself everyday, and its gonna happen soon.
i cut myself today, over 30 times as well, i hope that the burning feeling will take away how numb i feel, i sob so hard that i cant hear myself anymore,
i genuinly feel /numb/, i cant feel sadness anymore, i cant feel anything.
i want to just scream, scream until my voice leaves me completely, scream until everyone who's hurt me knows how badly they've hurt me.consider this my suicide note.side note; sorry for anything that isnt spelled correctly, im typing quite fast.kylie: thank you for being so easy on me when you let me go, i still love you, i think about you everyday, please find someone who treats you better than i ever could,
you deserve so much in life, youre so talented, so beautiful, you have so much potential, please dont be sad about my passing, im happy now.aaron: i bet you didnt exspect this, i wanted to thank you for so many smiles when i was low, sadly when im doing this its 12:21am your time, so you couldnt make me
happy since youre asleep. i love you, thank you for sticking by me through everyything alexis did to you. thank you for trusting me (kinda).luke: oh, where do i start with you? this is mostly your fault, after you broke my heart into a million peices, after you chose /it/ over me, thats when i really
made the decision to do this. you ruined me. fuck you, i hope you get everything you deserve. just yesterday i went to where you work, i heard your voice an saw your
beautiful smile, i broke down, i know you saw it, all you did was smile more. fuck you fuck you fuck you.carlos: what you did was my breaking point, you didnt really know though, you just left me to watch anime with your friend and thats what upset me, im sorry if im over
dramatic, but i love you. mom and sissy: i gave you both hints that i was gonna do this, but nobody acted fast enough, im sorry, i love you.dad: fuck you max: i know you need me, i need you as well, but you dont understand my depression well enough to help, im sorry, i love you.danny: i know you'll never see this, i really do, but you are the only reason i stuck around for as long as i did. you are my only sorce of real smiles and joyful

"Has anyone here actually been helped by going there?I need to hear some opinions before I actually take that step.I feel like I'm stuck being alive because hanging is my only sure option to commit suicide and I've failed at it/got cold feet twice this month and just ended up bruising and scaring my neck.My pain is to the the point where I NEED either death or medical help.One of those options are about to be taken VERY soon.That rope is still scary,but it's looking less and less scary by the day.",1

Felt like crap for a good week, understandably. I haven't really felt that upset since but my thoughts keep drifting to suicide, thinking about pretty graphic scenarios. I don't know what to do because every time I've tried to get help everyone makes a big deal out of it and I always feel worse.
I'm studying to become a high school science teacher which I really want to do but due to my lack of energy just am not doing too well (still passing). Last time I tried medication it worked for a bit but slowly stopped. I haven't tried another one for above reasons.
I used to write to help but just don't have the motivation. Even all my music reminds me of stupid and cringeworthy crap I've done. I swear I'm pushing my friends away even though they say I'm not. I think my family is ashamed of me.
I just don't know what to do, and my thoughts keep drifting...",1
having a mental breakdown rn because i cant even kill myself. im such a fucking pussy. i really should find some help,1
"Having perspective, my life could be so much worse I get it. I have a roof over my head, I have some money to feed myself, I've had some good times in the past. Yet, this isn't enough I realise. Selfish right. I have come to horrible realisation that I really do hate who I am. I used to like myself. I used to like how small and quirky I thought I was, how I liked culture, how people liked me. Now I realise people only like the surface of me, meeting me briefly is a pleasant account. I'm polite and nice but really, I have nothing to say when it comes to longer convos. I went to uni for a bit, put myself out there to meet loads of people but now I hardly keep in contact with anyone. I took a year out and this summer has been hard because almost everyone I know has had a good time with friends and family, even strangers that pop up on my facebook are having a better time than me. I now have had to delay going to uni due to how depressed I am. All I have been doing is sitting in bed depressed. I try to leave the house and do things but I do thing alone most of the time. Another thing is, I don't have a close family. I hardly speak to my mum. She feeds me and gives me money but we don't have any connection and I never really knew my dad, I don't have any close relatives who I speak to, I'm not ethnically English so I stand out from that, I look younger for my age, I've not been in a relationship, I was in care for many years but I don't keep in contact with the foster carers (long story) I knew, I have no basis. I went to a posh uni but came from poor background/area and grew apart from most people I went to school with. Having no constant socialising, I get lonely. I thought about trying to go out and meet new people but realise I'm not interesting enough. Even having a family you get on makes you more interesting. Even having friends you frequently do stuff with or chat you makes you more interesting. I don't have those things. I thought about reaching out to people I do know but most of them have their own lives and haven't really replied to me when I have started convo or tried to arrange to hang out. I am currently lounging at a friends house for free, his mum has been so nice and good to me but I now just feel guilty and if I do kill myself, it's going to hurt her as well as my friend. His mum doesn't even know me that well, I've just rocked up and she's taken me in. If it was a case of 'oh I need somewhere to stay' then fair, I wouldn't feel too too bad but its the fact that I am also so depressed you know...
I have other carers but they don't always contact or message me. They help me when I need it but can go ages without talking to me. Again, did I do something wrong to make them not give that unconditional love I feel like I deserve?
My friend works loads now so I don't see him which is good because I don't want to burden him with what I'm going through entirely (don't want to explain this one, I have my reasons). I need to get a job so I can start paying my friend's mum back. I'm in a new city and don't know anyone really. I don't think I'm really really strange or anything. I just think everyone has been way luckier than me in life. life has a funny way of making you feel guilty to be safe and lucky but will throw shit at you all the time until you can't cope. I'm a nice person. Before being where I am now, I was at uni and met few people who liked me. But they've all drifted from me and I also lived with people who weren't nice to me and I had nothing in common with. I think a lot of life is luck. I put myself out there but I got nothing back. I think maybe it's also due to where I came from and who I am personality wise that I can't hold down strong friendships. My facebook is full of people reminiscing funny shit they did with each other or photos with each other sayin how much they all love each other. All I long for is connection and unconditional love from some people. I want to discuss funny times, have good memories with people, share good things, invest time to grow and have hobbies, can go for drinks with people without feeling so empty. And when I do meet people, I've been stuck in my depression bubble for so long that I have nothing to say to people. I don't care about my hobbies anymore.
I am useless. I'm 21 living in the UK. There's no hope anymore, no help. Don't worry, I've tried to get help but it will stay like this as long as I am living this shitty life. Maybe some people were meant to not live...",1

One night when dad was meeting with his friends, he asked them for advice. He heard again the things he already tried. Then one of the guys sugested that he should send him to a catholic boarding school. Dad never heard or tried that one before, so he did it.Months pass by, dad surprisingly didn't get any notices from the school, no expell warnings of any kind. So one day he phones the school and asks principal how his son is doing. ""His grades are very good, his behaviour is excellent! You can be very proud of such child!"" says the principal, leaving the father even more confused. 
When it's time for semester break, son comes home and dad asks him:""What happened, why are you behaving this good?""Son answers: ""Dad, when I came to principal's office, there is a guy hanging on a cross behind him. On every corridor, there is a guy on a cross. In front of the school building there is a guy crucified! I tell you, they dont f**k around with people there!""",0

""That's easy,"" said St. Peter, ""You have to spend a day in each place before making a decision."" With that, he put the nurse on an elevator and sent her down to hell. The elevator doors opened and the nurse found herself in a sunny garden, where many former friends and colleagues warmly greeted her.  She had a great time all day laughing and talking about old times. That night, she had an excellent supper in a fantastic restaurant. She even met the devil, who turned out to be a pretty nice guy. Before she knew it, her day in hell was over and she returned to heaven. The day in heaven was okay. She lounged around on clouds, sang, and played the harp. At the end of the day, St. Peter came and asked for her decision. ""Well, heaven was great and all,"" the nurse said, ""but I had abetter time in hell. I know it sounds strange, but I choose hell.""  With that, she got in the elevator and went back down. When the doors opened, she saw a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. Her friends, dressed in rags, were picking up garbage and putting it in sacks. When the devil walked over, she said to him, ""I don't understand. Yesterday, this place was beautiful. We had a delicious meal and a wonderful time laughing and talking.""  The devil smiled and said, ""Yesterday we were recruiting you. Today you're staff.""",0

"Hello all, I would like to share my experience with the National Suicide Prevention Helpline, and get some input on both that and the original reasons I called in, but first, a little about me. I am a 27 year old college-educated female from a middle-class background.  I have a pretty typical story, physically and emotionally abusive dad and a mom that stood by and watched.  All of her emotional baggage was dumped on me from the beginning; from the times he would cheat, to her bankruptcy, she came to me to vent all of it every time.  I have looked out for her from the beginning, always putting her above myself since she had it so much harder, even getting between her and dad or her and my brother when verbal fights escalated. I became a drug addict at the age of 21 (opiates, of course), and have been battling that, too.  Anyhow, she spent her entire retirement money on a house near the beach to get away from dad, and took my heroin-addicted brother and his wife with her, instead of me, because they don't like me, even though I helped her find the house and it's her house.  She's always said I was her favorite and her best friend (although I don't believe you should be friends with your children).  She comes back to visit more often than not, which is good because I don't really leave the house, not even if I'm hungry.  As for the rest of it, very quickly, last year everyone died, and two years before that I made a plan that I have since perfected about killing myself (overdose) when my mom dies (she has an end-stage disease due to addiction), as I couldn't bear to hurt someone as badly as the loss of a child would hurt a mother.  The event that set this whole thing off was her telling me she would be home one day, then changing it to two days later, then changing it yet again.  I had a sort of epiphany, where I realized my entire life, she has told everyone only what she thought they wanted to hear, or what would keep a fuss down.  This included me.  I then realized that I was staying alive for someone who I'm not entirely sure really cares all that much about me.  There's much more, but that's the gist of it. As for the helpline, I know that they can only talk for a certain amount of time, and both phone calls lasted less than 5 minutes.  I told them I was 27, my mom had lied to me one too many times, and I have had a planned suicide for three years now.  One said ""Why can't you be happy that she's happy at the beach"", while the other said ""What were you calling about again"", and, as I repeated myself, was cut off and told that they're open 24/7.  Both of them made me feel like it was my fault and I was being selfish, I think mostly because they weren't listening. I'm obviously not upset that she's happy, I'm upset that she lies just to make things easier for herself, when she alone (well, along now with all you good people) knows how fragile I am.  I'm not going to make this post any longer; if you have any questions, please post them and I will answer as soon as possible. Thank you for reading my post.Update: Hello all, I appreciate each and every one of your replies.  It seems like those helplines aren't very helpful to some, who may just be those most in need.  Unfortunately, that's how it goes.  Someone asked why I don't leave the house often, and that's because I have severe depression and panic attacks, and, in spite of many different medications and combinations, along with therapy, none of it seemed to work in the decade between my diagnoses and when I lost my health insurance last year, so ERs are out of the question.  I'm glad (I guess?) that others have been through similar events, and grateful they could keep me company during a time of need.  Just a simple reply means so much during stressful situations, so to all those lurking, you never know how much you might help someone with one minute of your time.  Thank you.",1
"Hello everyone, I haven't posted much on reddit so I hope I'm not breaking guidelines. This is going to be a long write and honestly, I'm very grateful if someone reads all of this. To introduce myself, I am a 16-year-old in college. My parents are divorced and I have no siblings. I am an introvert and I have social anxiety. I have 3 friends in my life. I consider them all my best and only friends. Both of them moved very far away and are also busy with school and their jobs so it's very hard for me to talk to them. My mom fought stage 3 thyroid cancer ever since I was very young until 2013 where she got into remission.  In 2012, my parents divorced after years of constant fighting. I became aware of their fighting when I was 9 when I woke up 3 in the morning due to their fighting. Ever since then I have been fighting with depression since I am an introvert who was consistently bullied all throughout high school. I was hated by most people and I was consistently told by people in my class to ""just go kill yourself,"" ""no one likes you, so it would be better if you were just dead."" I have been struggling with the thought of suicide ever since I was 13. I have switched to many different schools, eventually, I would hear the same relentless words from my classmates and peers. I have attempted suicide twice, both times were unsuccessful when I was 13. I cut my wrists as a way to cope with my feelings. I have been through multiple psychologists and I would feel better for the time being, but after a few days, I would immediately feel like shit. I am constantly alone, but I have a fear of being rejected by people and staying alone. My mother knows about my depression, and she's tried to help before. I have consistent dreams about me killing myself, some feeling lucid. But I would always wake up to the horror that is reality. Fast forward to now, my mom has regained her thyroid cancer and now it has spread to her lungs. She fears that she won't be able to make tomorrow as she's consistently in the hospital. She's having a paid leave as she's in the hospital almost 24/7. I am struggling with my classes as I can't focus anymore. I'm dorming at my university but I feel alone even when I'm at a campus full of people. I can't decide my major and what I want to do with my life and it's all stressing me out. I'm scared of being alone and I have my thoughts tormenting me day and night. I'm emotionally unstable and I don't know what to do anymore. I have to find a way to pay my tuition and I can't get any student loans since I'm a minor. I also owe my father money since I spent a lot on my debit card. I can't love myself anymore, I stopped taking care of myself and I haven't slept or ate in the past few days. I would usually eat one meal a day and that's it. I'm trying to find a job to pay my dad and my school. I resorted to cutting my hair (I had very long hair) and selling it for $100. I can't afford anything and I have held on to that $100 for the longest time. I have told all my best friends about my current situation and it's not like how it used to be. I can't see them on a daily basis like how I used to and it really hurts. I hate being alone as an underaged kid in college with no family and no direction in life. As the school year has just started, I have no idea if I have the focus and motivation to be in my classes. I really want to be in college and hopefully, go to medical school or become an animator.I have constant suicidal thoughts that torment my mind and dreams almost every day and I can't seem to stop it. I've noticed that it has taken a significant toll on my attitude and relationships. I have become a very pessimistic and negative person that repulses everyone that I speak or interact with. I complain that I can't make any new friends or interact with people but I can't stop my negativity. If it wasn't for my supportive 3 best friends I have no idea where I would be right now. But most importantly, I'm terrified that I'm starting to get a personality that is like a sociopath. I have a full prescription of Minocycline 100 MG pills that is intended for my acne, but I just want to swallow it whole and end it all. I've tried twice before and failed. Hopefully, third time is the charm. I'm scared. I want to die but I also don't want to die. I'm confused and helpless. I don't know how to help myself or how to practice self-care anymore. I want to give up. I need somebody. Anybody. ",1
"Hello everyone,Recently, I've been in a state where, for the past couple of weeks now, I've been at a loss of any kind of interaction with my ""friends."" For further context, I found that even with new friends that I've made through school, hospitalization, etc, just don't care about me and I feel as if they pass me off as if I don't exist. Before pushing them away because of this in these past couple of weeks, I would always genuinely wonder how they were doing, so I'd ask, with little to no responses. I just know it goes a long way with me when someone takes time to ask me how I'm doing, so I'd try to communicate with my friends as much as possible, because I love and care about them. But would they say the same back? The thing is, in these past few months, any friend that I've had has left me for something or someone better over different situations, and those that still try and put minimal effort into being relevant in my life rarely ever call or text to say hi, or ask how I'm doing... It hurts, you know? I'm not trying to come off as egotistical, but I've always cared for people in my life, and I always look to let them know I care just by being there for them, whenever. And I guess maybe I'm invisible to them, or not important on their own paths in life, based on how they treat me back.
It's always been me texting, or calling first, despite the immense amounts of anxiety that it gives me.. I'm sorry, I know it doesn't sound like much of a problem, but I haven't always had friends. Just recently in high school, sophomore year (Junior now) was when things started to pick up for me in my social life, things were going great, for awhile actually... and now, like I should've anticipated, everything seems to be against me. People I used to talk to don't bother with me anymore, I can't show my face in school because of rumors spread last school year... and even those friends that stuck after those rumors settled, the ones that I knew wouldn't buy the bullshit, have just seemed to... vanish, I guess? They weren't saying anything to me for days, so I just turned my phone off.. because I was hurting enough already from other things I won't talk about in this. I turned it on to post this however, and there was still... nothing. I don't know what I did to those close friends I still had, I barely know why rumors were started about me, other than that I heard my ex spread them to see me suffer again when I, and they knew that I was moving on and doing better. In short, I don't know why I'm being treated like this. High school is a nasty place. Being a teenager is even worse. My depression and anxiety have seemed to skyrocket from years ago, and only keep affecting me more and more everyday, and I just don't know how much more of it I can take. I've already been hospitalized because of a suicide attempt several months ago over being trapped in my own thought, and because of those rumors that ultimately led to a bad rep, harassment, and bullying. To note, I'm still harassed by people connected with my ex, which I also guess goes as cyberbullying as well; another reason why I keep my phone off. I just wish those people knew the truth. I wish they could've heard me crying for days and nights on end because of how one false rumor led to... a lot. Truly, a lot. That I, my family, friends that stuck with me, and god, even my ex probably subtly knew I didn't deserve. Anyway. Being in that mental hospital for a week put a lot of strain on my family, and honestly, being lonely like this everyday sure as hell doesn't benefit them, as it only makes my depression so much worse to be isolated like this. My point is, the thoughts of thinking that life is meaningless are returning because my experiences in life have only proven that this happens time and time again... Never has a single person in my life just... seemed to have cared, like, legitimately. As in, sure, I've had nurses that have taken care of me, therapists that listen to me, and other forms of support, but there's one thing in common with them all, and it's that they likely know they're being paid to care about me. Saying that sounds fucked, but I do know they're good-hearted people... it's just, paying people to hear me out doesn't seem too right in my mind. I think it's more right that we should be able to share our emotions, our problems, and just pay ourselves in the way of knowing that we simply helped someone. I'd say the only person that cares, deep down, is my Mom, but I've stopped telling her about my problems because I feel as if it'd be easier for her if I stopped, and just died, after all the emotional stress I've especially put on her, and the rest of my family. I'm in the process of writing and rewriting notes for when I decide to leave. It's only a matter of time before something new pushes me over the edge, or when that thought telling me that life will always be like this wins. And it'd truly be for good this time, I promise myself that. Maybe I should set a date, and if things aren't better by then... yeah.I'm sorry if this was long. I needed a place to put my mind onto paper, where people would see it and hopefully understand me, for once in a long, long time. I've never sent or posted anything this long, so I may regret and delete it, but the thought will still remain from the paragraph before this one. Back to binging Netflix. I should also note that my Mom thinks I'm slowly becoming anorexic based on how little she thinks I eat everyday, and the weight loss she's noticed. I don't know if this is the right place to post about that, but regardless, I've come to realize after a bit she may be right... We all struggle with something, so from my heart, I hope the best and most peaceful moments for everyone here... Feel free to reply, I'd really appreciate it...

"Hello everyone. Long post. I'll try to hit up a TLDR at the end.Don't know how to approach this. I did have a very dramatic and depressive phase back when I was about 17 all throughout 20 or so. I was in a relationship that was extremely emotionally taxing. I'm an emotional guy, fell in love with someone and wanted to marry said person. Like any teenager would say, probably. I attempted suicide once by swallowing a bunch of pills. Not one second after I did that, I started feeling regret and forced myself to throw up all of it. That was then.That relationship ended. I started another one some time later, during my mid 20s (girl was in her late teens). Relationship was perfect for me. She was the prefect girl We had a falling out about a year and half into our relationship. I broke up with her because of the fact that I was under a lot of emotional stress and she wasn't there on a very specific event (regarding someone's death) because we had had a silly fight before. Bad decision on my behalf, I know. During those months apart, I hooked up with some chick. Nothing serious and we didn't have sex, only fooled around.Two months after our breakup, she called me, we started seeing each other again. I told her there was someone I was seeing during that time, but that was that. We got back together after a month and a half of seeing one another again. For the past 2+ years, things were really nice. She was a tad bit colder lately, but she's been taking medication (doctors warned us that the medicine would affect her behaviour) and just finished college and got a job that is very time demanding. I understood that.Out of the blue, she called me and broke up with me not too long ago. She said she doesn't feel the same way and hasn't been able to overcome what happened two years ago. She's a really honest person, she's not your average girl. She's very old-school too. Before me, she hadn't even kissed anyone. And during the almost 4 year long relationship, she didn't want to have sex as she wanted to save herself for marriage (which I understood).This broke my heart. I love her and even planned on proposing this very month. But that's not the only thing. I have had decently-paying jobs, achieved several stuff at work and gained recognition amongst the high end personnel. That said I hated every single job and quit a couple of months ago to do some soulsearching.I spent two months depressed. Not because I didn't have a job, but because I can't find what is it that I want to do. I had no motivation. I told her I felt down all the time, except when I was around her.  Income is not an issue, I have a substancially large amount of savings in the bank - if I were to live off barely minimums, I could probably sustain myself for 3 or 4 years before having to work again. Money is not the issue.I just feel I have nothing left. I asked her to reconsider, to spend a week together thinking about stuff before making a decision. She said she didn't know if that was a good idea and said she'd think about it but decided to ""stay bf and gf"" until the decision was made. That was Wednesday afternoon. We agreed we wouldn't talk to one another until she decided, to give her time to think. She hasn't answered so far.This is killing me. I feel like the only thing that is keeping me here is the fact that there's a 0.1% chance she'll decide not to break up. I feel pathetic, never did I thought I'd be so emotionally dependant on someone but I feel like I have nothing else. The one thing I loved and was sure of is leaving me. I don't want to kill myself, I just want to be dead. If I knew about a 100% efficient method, that was quick and painless... trust me, I'd be making the necessary preparations.TLDR: Professional Crisis depression coupled with long-time girlfriend (who I was gonna propose to this month) leaving me for a fight we had 2 years ago has lead me to contemplate suicide. I feel like killing myself even though I'm not financially or socially estranged. Haven't felt this way since I was a teenager almost 10 years go. Worst sensation I've experienced in my life.",1
"Hello everyone.Today at school, I was putting up my cello in orchestra class, and someone was blocking my locker. I asked him to move, but he didn't respond, so I poked him. However, after I poked him, he (much bigger guy than me) came over and attempted to poke me back. In an attempt to protect myself, I curled up, and when doing so, punched a large hole in the side of my cello (in the ribs). I looked up the cost of repairing such a hole, and I nearly fainted from it - it is around $800! When I came home from school, I told my parents, and both of them absolutely blew it. They told me ""it's only been the first 5 weeks of school and you already have caused so many problems! You first forget to turn in a homework, then you get bullied on the bus, and I had to write an email to the principal, and now you punch a hole in your cello? Why can't you ever consider the consequences of anything? Why didn't you just take the poke? Why did you try to curl up? What is wrong with you?"" My dad later told me that ""our family tries to save so much money, and now, you blow all the money that we saved by a huge accident? What the hell is wrong with you?"" I have told them a few times in the past that I have felt sometimes that if I was gone, the world would be much happier, but then they tell me that I shouldn't use the word ""depression"" and suicide is the most selfish thing one can perform and then they yell at me for like an hour. Please help!",0
"Hello guys, 18yo,  I'm new here and I'm psychologically exhausted. I'm really thinking about suicide. I me few months ago a girl on a website, from a foreign country. We started to talk a lot and this until today, nearly a year. She told me she was major, in university, nothing special. Then, after many talks we started to have feelings and started a long distance relationship. She was shy and never sent many pics, but she totally looked like a young adult. Our relation became very serious, with family involved, projets about future and live together. Of course, we went to talk about sex and had sexual convos. Then, I knew that she is diagnosed bdp, sociopath, paranoid (i knew it before her lies) She lied to me about everything : age, past, experiences, studies, all. She is in fact really younger than me. Her parents thought she told me, but no, she lied to them too. This gap never bothered them, me I didn't know. When knew, I got shocked and hurted. (Her previous bf was 25, never bothered them)Problem is : her family and her father are ultra religious conservative. Since i was the first guy she talked sexually, they push me to marry her in few years. Despite the fact they know she lied to me. More, they threaten and blackmail me : If i betray her or leave her, they threaten me to go to court and law. Her brother threaten me of death. And since she is completely paranoid, she thinks I betrayed and told to her father that wanna destroy me like told before. Despite all my efforts to explain I never betrayed.I'm exhausted, I did many things for that girl, but she lied to me about all. I'm exhausted, I can't run away except suicide. I know too that her father and brother beats her with a belt.I don't know what to do, I'm exhausted and wanna die",1
"Hello I am 16 years old and I want to kill myself. It would make all this go away. I don't deserve to be on this earth since I can't make friends due to my social anxiety and my anxiety in general. I want to make friends, but it is hard for me to. I have no had any messed up experiences in my life, but I have social anxiety, generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder. I also am a big perfectionist. I want to be smarter than that guy next to me and if I'm not I write notes on paper of how worthless and stupid I am. I want to become someone in the IT field but I'm too stupid to get in there anyways, and jobs nowadays need social people and I am not one of them. I've never had a girlfriend before, and I want to have one because being a virgin is a bad thing and I could never live with that feeling. If I don't have any friends or a girlfriend when I'm an adult I plan on committing suicide. Can you please help me? Thanks for reading.",1
"Hello I'm a Junior in high school who has social problems, so I suffer from severe shyness,and social anxiety due to me being introverted. Even when I get picked on/ also in class and I still talk my body still feels so shaky, and I fucked up in Piano Class I was trying to play Rock Along. My hands were full of sweat yesterday and it was noticeable that my voice was shaking. Anytime, I raise my hand my heart beats so when the teacher isn't looking I put it down. I'm too shy to ask for help and embarrassed by this. Same for my Math class, my mom was right ""If you have questions, then ask the teacher and don't come home clueless about the math HW."" I suffer from a bad past. I got bullied in middle school and 5th and 6th grade for having dandruff. In middle school I told through counselor and she just gave the bully, what you may ask was the consequence? Only 2 lunch detentions and ironically that counselor was bullying me about ""(My name) if you have bad grades, i'm going to call your parents."" Then, I told her that it was not right embarrassing me in front of my friends. She started crying and saying ""I'm sry."" I gave her a 2nd chance and she refused to change my classes and said go talk to the principal :/. I literally even avoided to swear at her and that was attempting. I hope I never run into that bad counselor Ms. Dukes ever again. I'm so glad I left that school to high school, that bullying is not much a problem to me compared to in middle school. Also, my 8th grade English teacher humiliated me and saying that ""You have an F in my class. Gotta fix that F."" I mean, I understand that I have a bad grade, but doesn't mean you can freaking embarrass me in front of the class. Then, I told the principal and he said he ""was sry."" The next week, he said the N word and then said ""(my name) Hope this doesn't offend you, don't call your parents."" He laughed like a complete idiot and don't understand why he hasn't been divorced yet. Someone in 6th grade asked me about this word and then I answered it in the way that it means. Then, he proceeds to say ""Eww, gross."" He spreads the rumor about me in my class, and in this program W.I.N we have every morning, my friends won't sit by me anymore and I literally cried. The principal assigned lunch seats and I just sat there quietly and was a loner. This boy was bothering me in the lunch line, luckily I got him to back off since a teacher was there. He almost beat me up in the bathroom but I defended myself and fell, but I was okay. He ran away like a coward. After winter break, I started to be cool with them and told them not to believe that kind of stuff. I will never miss elementary school and middle school. I don't know how to find the scale factor of 2 shapes.  I can't fucking take it anymore, and when I was younger, I would always slap myself on the side of my cheeks for being an idiot. Sometimes, I still do. I just wanna get these thoughts out of my head.I'm selfish I care what others think of me.In 6th grade, someone choked me and couldn't almost breathe for a minute was painful. I spilled soap on my sister's face because I'm a fucking idiot who does bad stuff and the wrong thing.. Then, I couldn't breathe again for a bit. I feel like i talk about myself too much and just am stupid. Sometimes, I feel like I'm not there at a place and just zone out for some reason. Why bother to feel live if there's not much hope? I keep stressing myself out and procrastinating a lot. I always had a thought of torturing myself with a pillow.",0

"Hello reddit, i finally decided to find some help.in the next few days i wanna go visit a psychiatrist, and i was wondering if i should tell her everything (that i failed a suicide attempt last week and that i still have suicidal thoughts), or just that i'm depressed and socially awkward?what will she do ? can she inform anybody ? or she's just going to talk about it with me and prescribe me some medication ?",1
"Hello! Last year I suffered a concussion that gave me some awful symptoms including brain fog, memory loss, decline in social skills, extremely uncomfortable feelings in the back of my head and more. It was too much to cope with, especially after 4 months of going to doctors and not getting any diagnosis. I decided killing myself was the only way to escape my seemingly eternal condition. I set a date in May and started planning. Around February, I started feeling a little less bad and the doctors also prescribed me some medicine and exercises to get me on the right track, so I stopped feeling suicidal.At some point during the first four months when I was still trying to figure out what exactly was wrong with me, I visited an ENT and he prescribed me nose spray (which ended up having nothing to do with the problem) I started noticing some weird feelings in my nose and ear after taking it for a couple weeks so I stopped. The nose feeling never really went away though. Fast forward about 6 months, and I was almost fully healed from the concussion symptoms. All of the sudden, the nose symptom got a lot worse. My entire left nostril felt like the contents had been sucked out of it with a vacuum and now the flow of air is way too strong. All of the air flowing in makes both my throat dry and soar all the time, and creates this irritating scrapey feeling above my left ear. On top of that, it seems like some of the brain fog symptoms I was describing earlier have returned along with this thing and I feel like my entire head is a mess again.I'm currently visiting some doctors to see if they can provide any insight, but dealing with it for a month and only seeing it get worse is really demoralizing. I feel depressed and anxious constantly and kinda feel like I wanna die again. Idk how long I'm gonna be able to hold on this time if my body keeps bombarding me with all of these symptoms.Just really needed to vent somewhere, thanks for reading",1
"Hello, everyone. Recently, I've found it very hard to not think about suicide. I have had depression, sleeping disorders, and many suicidal thoughts for 6 years now. I am now 17, and all I do is sit in my empty room almost every day, no family except a father who is rarely ever here, no pets that would provide any entertainment from the loneliness, nothing. But even if I were to see my family again, I have lost the ability to have a normal conversation, all I do is yell, even if I'm not mad, I just tell them to go away. It's hard to say, but I have felt so down this last week than I have my entire life, and that's saying something because I've attempted before, but right now I have not made any actions, because it's different this time. This time, I've felt so empty and void of feelings, and sometimes even of consciousness, because I would usually just sleep all the time, trying to avoid everything else, but I can't do that anymore. It doesn't work. I don't even have another viable solution to this, as I don't have friends to talk to anymore, since I can't find myself being nice to people as I used to be, and I would like to get rid of myself so that nobody has to worry or care about me anymore. I have no way of getting a job, every time I walk out of my house or see people I hold back major anxiety and pain because of how hard it is to even do that. It's been three years since I've last shed a tear, but what pushed me to the edge and made this painful week start was the realization that I wouldn't amount to anything in adulthood. Actually, I don't even know how long it's been since this started, I lose track of time a lot because I never leave my room, I just sleep or use my worthless computer to make worthless progress on worthless games. I have no one to talk to who would understand, the only people I would talk to would just call the police and get me arrested for it again. I haven't harmed myself in any way for quite a while, but that's not considerably a good thing because back when I was doing that, I wasn't making a plan to end my life or writing a goodbye story. It's so hard to continue about this thinking that nobody I know will ever see it, but all I want before I leave is for someone to read this, and maybe help someone they know suffering before it's too late, like it is too late to help me. I currently don't have a written plan, but I've been thinking of taking a big jump, or hanging, or hopefully finding a gun, but I want to do it, and soon. Very soon. I can't keep waking up at midnight after sleeping for 12 hours and wondering what I'm gonna do all alone today, and how I'm going to handle every waking hour of my life doing it, even though I can't change myself to do something else even though I want to. The only reason I'm not gone right now is because I'm too scared of what the pain I may experience will be like. But I hope I can soon find the most quick and painless way to make it all end, and I'm trying my hardest to find how to do that. EDIT: To add a little bit more before I really leave, For a year now, I've had nobody to rely on. No girlfriend, no family, no friends, nobody to even talk to. It's not like I couldn't go out and get some new friends or date again, but it seems pretty pointless to me now that I can no longer be helped. All people do when you get to know them is cheat on you, or do some fucked up shit behind your back. That's my only experience with other people. Not once have I been able to meet someone and trust them with much. I've also not been able to handle school, let alone going and getting a job. School had always been hell and prison combined for me, and the people in it always sucked too. But anyway, I did find out there is a pretty high train bridge not far from where I live. Hopefully this will work. I might go there tomorrow, maybe in a week, but no longer than that.If you cared enough to read all of this, thank you. And goodbye.",1

I want to commit suicide. I don't know what is available for me to get here. I have tried slicing my wrists before and it failed.
I was thinking I could take some rat poison or somethinf like that. There is no place in my room to hang myself from.
I just want to kill myself. My life is full of too much pain.
I wish I could get a gun or something. What ways are there besides a gun or wrist slitting or hanging.
I am just looking for the most efffectivw way. Pleasw help. Thanks",1
"Hello, I'll keep this short as possible. I'm considering suicide and hanging is the only way I can afford at the moment. I don't have anything to keep myself up, I mean nothing condemned to the roof of the room so I think I'll tie a rope to the heating radiator and jump from the window. I live in 3rd floor which is far enough from the ground. My questions are, if I don't get a neck break how much will it take for me to die and will I make any sound during the hanging phase? I'll do it at night so no one can interrupt my attempt but If it takes more than 2 mins top I'll probably be saved and taken into a mental hospital.

"Hello, I'll keep this short as possible. I'm considering suicide and hanging is the only way I can afford at the moment. I don't have anything to keep myself up, I mean nothing condemned to the roof of the room so I think I'll tie a rope to the heating radiator and jump from the window. I live in 3rd floor which is far enough from the ground. My questions are, if I don't get a neck break how much will it take for me to die and will I make any sound during the hanging phase? I'll do it at night so no one can interrupt my attempt but If it takes more than 2 mins top I'll probably be saved and taken into a mental hospital.

"Hello, I'm not really even sure why I'm making this post other than I need to say this to someone and I can't say it to anyone else. I moved to the Midwest and took a job I hate for a terrible boyfriend that I have since broken up with. He was the kind of person who thought that depression was some kind of character flaw so I pretended a lot around him. Well the great and terrible thing about being broken up is that I no longer have to pretend that I am not depressed. I rarely eat unless someone is watching. Why eat if I just have to do it again later. It's so monotonous. All of the dishes I own have been in my sink for like a week. My carpet is mostly dog hair. I can't concentrate at work because it's so useless and stupid. And not just because I'm depressed, my job is objectively stupid and useless.  I'm having a really hard time not snapping at my coworkers or the one friend that I have in a 2 hour radius. I go in and out of these episodes once every couple weeks. I absolutely hate it here and have hated it since I got here, but I feel like I shouldn't just burn my life to the ground in a fit and leave without lining up a job and having a good plan. The plan is in the works but it's slow going and I don't know how much longer I can hang on here, which feels dramatic to say but it's true. During these depressive episodes,  on the way to work I am overcome with the urge to drive into a tree or guard rail and sometimes I white knuckle my steering wheel just to make sure I don't do it. When I open the door to work and someone says ""good morning"" it's like all that's going on in my head is screaming and I want to run off a bridge- which I know is ridiculous. During the past couple weeks I have been thinking about dying, death, and suicide more than I usually do during a depressive episode and I just need to move back to my home state. I'm afraid of how isolated I am and I just really, really, hate it here. I genuinely think that I will be a lot happier once I get out of here, but I'm afraid that I might do something terrible in a moment of insanity in the meantime. It's like some days my brain just jams and I get really upset at everything going on around me and all I can think is ""KILL YOURSELF"" and I have to fight it until the urge passes. Like throwing up or something. It's very strange. Anyway, thank you for listening to me ramble on. I feel a lot better just getting that off my chest. ",1
"Hello, it's me again. I made a post about three weeks ago saying that i was giving life another chance, but if it didn't work out, i'd attempt on the 11th. Well, look where i am now - tried to kill myself under a bridge and ended up having to go to the hospital. Been kept out of school and have had my parents anxiously looking over my shoulder these past two weeks, and honestly, i wish i had just died right there. Nothings gotten better. My friends hate me now - they blame me for everything when really, it wasn't their drama to begin with. Meddlers gonna meddle i guess. And my ex, well, he can go straight to hell. Maybe i'll see him there when i die.Honestly though, my attempt may have scared me off for a little while but i doubt that i'll live out to see Halloween. Or rather, i don't exactly want to. It's not like it would be a spur of the moment decision - i have a note, and little individual messages written for the fuckers who made everything worse. So i guess i'm just waiting for another reason to go. Why stay alive when everything has gone to shit?",0

I have entertained the idea briefly years back. My mother has been very sick for sometime and I don't think I can hold on any longer.

"Hello.  I am not sure who else to turn to so I am on here.  I have been with my soulmate for 4 years now and with her I was able to get this amazing job, but recently I have messed it all up.  Well, during the relationship I have been cause texting other woman and this most recent time was the last straw.  I don't blame her for wanting to leave, but I don't understand why I do it either.  I know in my heart I love her, but it's like I'm two different people.  Anyways, I don't think she is going to stay with me anymore and on top of that I am probably going to lose my job and all my friends/family.  I don't want to move on to anything else.

I will find out soon if she will ultimately leave me, which means I will find out soon if I am going to commit suicide.  I don't know what else to do or anything and I'm lost.

"Hello. I don't know why I'm making this, I'm not trying to be edgy or anything. Just wanting to explain how I feel, Maybe some of you might get it.
I'm suffering.. I don't remember the last time I was actually okay, lately every thing feels like an effort for everyone but myself. They say its good for me. No its only good for them to see another person go into their agenda. Living a social life, a lie. Its a lie to me. Fuck this bullshit. Everyday is misery and no one notices my pain. They only notice what I've true doing to get out of this Fucking life. Living. I don't feel like I'm living. The only reason I'm not dead already is because of this one girl 3 k miles away.Im a piece of shit. White privileged piece of shit. At least I have a job and papers but god i feel so useless. I don't want to get up everyday. I don't want to breath. Sometimes I try seeing if I can just stop breathing. Or shut off a part of my brain that makes me remember to breath. So I can just fall and die. But if I did, shed be in pain and god who knows if this pain will go away while I'm aliveLast week I got diagnosed for severe depression. Anxiety and bipolar disorder. Fuck. I don't want to be here. I don't want to see people looking at me different. If I just did go through with my death I hope people could move on. Just move on, but no. Apparently I'm just seeking attention. ""Crying for help"" Fuck them all. I don't want help. I'm not crying for attention. I'm only here because I don't want my fiance to die. I only went to therapy last week and to get diagnosed because my girlfriend was worried about me. Because I laid on the train tracks.
I just want them all to leave me alone. What is wrong with me? I don't know.  Literally every thing. I don't have motivation anymore. Anything else I do is just to please everyone else. To be a ""great HAPPY citizen"" and a part of ""society""
I'm isolated. Even with therapy. I keep getting worse. Angrier. Sadder. I'm just trying to hold on to this.
I'm scared that all my problems are making my girl's problems worse ",1
"Hello.
I am relatively new to reddit, and it's a bit sad to say it's because of this subreddit I have finally decided to become an active user. Not in the sense that this subrredit led me to becoming suicidal, more in the sense that I've come to this website more and more to escape from my life. And today was the culmination of all of it, because I've found a place where I don't have to lie or pretend to be someone I'm not. I'm a compulsive liar; I suspect that is so because I want to retain a sense of control over my life, but that is a topic for another time.
I still don't feel comfortable enough to post my own story here. Not that I don't trust the people here, it's just difficult for me posting something so personal somewhere so public, which i know is paradoxical, because it's a public anonimity, and everyone's intention here is to help or to seek out helpfor themselves, but still, I have a hard time showing my own wounds to anyone but me in the mirror (that sounded really cringy, sorry about that).
What I really wanted to do in this post is to commend everyone that put time away just so they could help others that are going through similar situations. The energy you guys dispense is your own, you are sharing these beautiful, sincere and absolutely touching messages of togetherness and understanding, that you can hear these scattered individuals' silent screams and that they sound unfortunately familiar to a lot of other people's. Your fight is your own, but the pain you feel is close to somebody else's. That loneliness, that separation everyone who has ever had something like this in their lives has gone through, that feeling of an especially made pain for you, don't hold on to it, don't nurture it. Remember that many have beaten it, so can you, so can I, so can everyone in this subreddit.
I am typing this message for you guys because you too deserve support. I know for a fact you've saved lives, but unfortunately people don't recognize you much for it, and i know that is not the point, nevertheless I admire your courage and perseverance. You are amazing, thank you!
For the ones in more precarious situations, the ones that write or read for support of their own, i have a bit of advice. Some days ago i was feeling especially down, so I decided to walk alone. I talk to myself a lot, so I kept reciting these sad mumblings about my life to myself. I just know that at some point I started to run, with tears going down my face and with me just insulting life in general. It helped. There was a lot I had inside of me, and fortunately it helped. I have been worse than this, bound to my bed, empty and cold. I can feel that coming back. In those times, I tried suicide. Never managed to go through. But Im being completely honest, what kept me going was a violent hatred for life, fear and self-doubt. I dont have any self-confidence, so i just kept questioning my decisions. Strangely enough, that helped me get through that rough patch.
The conclusion Im trying to reach is, dont feel inadequate for your sadness, dont feel like a coward for being afraid, and dont feel like its your fault life is shit. I know its easier said than done, but truly, remember you, your body, your mind, whatever you want, its fighting for you to stay alive. Your knowledge of your situation may help you help others, your pain can one day become a strength unlike anybody else's.  If so many have battled through, you can too, you've taken a beating, now use that blood to, uh, idk,  fucking skate over and punch life straight in the dick.
And if you need, just come back herem and we will remind you why life is better than what it feels like.
Much strength my dudes, and wish me some too!",1

"Here's what happened. Last year, I entered college as a freshmen. I was assigned a roommate, who was very creepy in how I would come home and he would be in my bed, claiming he was ""tired."" However, he was not the creep, I was.One time when we were sleeping, I was looking at pornography on my porn and slightly rubbing my penis on the mattress, I accidentally made myself climax. I felt terrible for what I did, especially being unsure if my roommate saw what was happening at the time. I have OCD, and I am currently getting treatment for it, but before I got treatment, I wanted to find out if he really saw me. So I planned to masturbate on multiple nights to see if he would say something or notice me (I would masturbate by quietly thrusting the mattress, with blankets covering me.On one night, when we were going to bed, he said ""I'm actually gonna go read for a while, good night."", and left. I was mortified because I didn't know if that meant that he knew what I was doing. When he got back, I masturbated again by quietly thrusting the mattress to see if he noticed.I'm going to kill myself because I feel terrible having to put him through that. I feel like a creep and a pervert and I don't deserve to live. He doesn't talk to me because I moved last October due to me not being comfortable with how he would be in my bed when I got home and him messing with my stuff.

"Hey all,I've been having financial problems for the past 7 years or so and it's not because I'm financially undisciplined, in fact I'm frugal and smart about my money. I have terrible luck with employment (only ever had 1 full time job) and I am trying to save money to finish college. I have 3 courses left to finish college and get my bachelor's degree but the lack of it is heavily impeding my chances of holding a steady job that pays me enough to pay my student loans as well as save money for college.Due to this, I resorted to freelancing. It's been great, I've made some money but this financial problem is also with my family and whatever I earned I helped them and I paid my student loan that's due every month. But freelancing is volatile and right now I have an employer who will potentially give me projects but he needs to wait for his clients to pay him. Honestly at this point, I'm fully expecting it to fizzle out because life always finds a way to fuck me anyway.I blame nobody but myself. The path I've gone down has been hard and I could have chosen the easier path, but I made mistakes. All I want is to be able to earn a steadier income to help me build my life but life is just obstructing my path. If this project doesn't come through I'm back to square one and I feel like I should kill myself because I'm running out of energy to even handle this anymore. I'm lost and my mistakes have made a heavy impact on my family and myself. Why bother living if I consistently get fucked over no matter how hard I work and if I just caused burden and hardship to my family and myself? Fuck this life.Also, I don't have any issues with self esteem, women, etc. I'm a pretty normal person and I only need a damn job and money to get me out of this rut. I'm willing to sacrifice a limb or a couple of limbs if it means getting me out of this, honestly.",1
"Hey all.It just feels good to get this out. I understand this isn't a relationship subreddit but the context is necessary here. We've been dating since 2015, long distance, then lived together for over a year. The relationship was honestly perfect. We treated each other extremely well and there was nothing to complain about. He has bipolar and depression, I have anxiety and depression, I guess both of our fatal flaws were never seeing a therapist. We always figured we could help each other through our mental health. We never really took our mental illnesses out on each other.Two months ago I had an ugly jealous feeling in my gut to check the messages he had a year ago with a mutual friend of ours, ""Jane."" He had a thing with her before he and I met, and for the first part of our relationship she was really friendly with me AND him but something always felt off to me. I did what I'd never done before and read his messages with her. Found out for the first 4 months of our relationship, he was basically cheating on me with Jane, asking her to come over for netflix and chill, saying I love you, complimenting her, saying ""but I'm not a cheater though lol."" In the same conversation, they would then talk about how great I was. Total brainfuck.After reading that I went on a drive. This was the first time I had ever felt angry at him. I called my best friend hysterical saying how much I hated him and I just wanted to die. She talked me down and about an hour and a half later I come home, my now-ex realizes I read his messages and responds to my tears with a scoff, asking why I'm making such a big deal out of something that happened so long ago. I break down crying because I had been cheated on in a very similar situation in my last relationship. He then breaks down crying about how he doesn't deserve me/doesn't understand why I'm with him, etc. I spend the rest of the night reassuring him that I'm not going to leave, that he isn't a bad boyfriend, that I need time but I can forgive him, etc.I guess that was the start of the end.He went from full-time to part-time in the job he was doing extremely well at. I advised against it but it wasn't my call to make, and we could pay bills just fine if he went to part-time. Shortly after, I noticed him slipping into a depressive spiral. He'd drink beer and play league of legends literally any moment he wasn't at work. I'd wake up, he's playing league. Get back from the gym, he's playing league. Make breakfast, he's still playing league. Come home from work, he's still playing league just with two empty bottles of booze next to him now. I figured this was all just depression, and I needed to let him cope. So I'd sit on his lap while he'd play video games, ask him if he's winning, kiss him on the cheek, whatever. Then the day would end, we'd have sex, all good right?The last month has been hell. I had felt completely neglected and like I was just an annoyance to him. I beat myself up so much on the inside that my anorexic tendencies started coming back. My seizure disorder came back full swing. There was one instance where I was so disoriented I threw up in the bed all over the sheets, myself, and my hair then passed out. I woke up and he was sleeping on the floor while I'm still covered in puke that had been sitting for 6 hours. When he went to work, I had to drag myself out of bed, shower off puke (sitting down, I couldn't even stand) and hose off our sheets before running out the door to work. The fact he didn't even offer to help should have been a sign that he just didn't care anymore?I would sit down with him often and ask how he was. He always said he was fine, just needed to ""decompress."" Several times I was crying, asking him why I felt like I annoyed him every time I talked to him and what I could do differently. Nothing ever changed.So during that month I was hardly eating, going to the gym, getting a seizure every other week, and still doing all the housework. Cooking, cleaning, laundry, it was exhausting. I dropped out today, but at the time I was still a full time college student. And working full time. He just had a part time job and wouldn't do anything around the house to help.My full time job has also been shitty but it provided us a place to live (weird housing situation). So I'm sure hating my full time job and having all the stress of full time college too just made it worse but I had no other choice. If I didn't work there full time, there was nowhere for us to live, end of story.The day he left, I had another talk with him. We had plans to move to another state soon so I can finish my degree at a school I've been excited to attend, which is also by his hometown. I think I scared him by giving him an ultimatum and saying I wasn't sure how things are going to work if it continues like this. I couldn't keep doing literally everything on top of full time work and school and my declining health. He got a really weird look in his eyes and said ""I know I need to make some changes."" That night I come home from work and nearly everything of his is gone. He left about a 7 sentence note, his pet leopard gecko, and just no-showed to his job (he's fired now) and went back to his hometown.The relationship was real shitty at the end but oh my god I miss him. I keep getting flashbacks to all these good memories (2 years is a long fucking time) and wondering what the hell I did wrong. I hid my eating disorder pretty well from him so I know that wasn't it. Maybe I nagged? Maybe it was the seizures? If I had known he was so miserable I would've said fuck it to my job and college and gone anywhere he wanted, done anything he wanted, whatever. I've always been an extreme people-pleaser. I would have done anything to make him stay.Either way this has thrown me real fucking deep into a hole of self-hatred and depression and I've physically been unable to eat for the last 5 days. He left me on Wednesday, it's now Monday and the only thing I've been able to consume is 10 oz of cranberry juice yesterday.My mom wants me to go into inpatient. I'm thinking why waste 3 days in a hospital when now's a better time than ever to kill myself. I won't have to worry about my weight, about transferring my credits, about missing him, about explaining myself to his family (they're all distraught), anything.Things are pretty dark right now. I've lost my reason to live and I'm not physically or mentally strong enough to carry myself through the stress of such a fucking terrible breakup. On the bright side I'm back to my goal weight of 115lbs. The end.",1
"Hey everyone. Never thought I'd end up on here...but here I am. I just need to get my words out before I go insane. I don't even know where to start. I'm a 23/M, and I want this all to end, for real. I've been feeling like this on and off for about 10 years. My first suicidal thoughts started when I was in 7th grade (~2007), and I've had a few breaks from it, but they always come back harder and harder. I'm starting to have really bad thoughts and I can't focus on anything. My manager at work has had to talk to me about my performance. I really think that if my brother wasnt a manager there, I'd be out. (Yeah, can't find a job on my own. Nepotism has gotten me pretty much every job I've ever had.. lol)I don't mean to get too intense here, but I have recurring thoughts of blowing my face off with a shotgun.  I can almost feel the  go through my body, and sometimes it makes me cringe.  Thats not how I want to go, though. Something a little more peaceful. It's an image in my head that is stuck on repeat. Like a song stuck in my head. I always struggled in school ever since I can remember. I was put on medication to try and help me focus, but it just made me feel sick. All through my childhood I had to take all these mental tests, I had to go to speech therapy because I couldnt talk right (I still have trouble pronouncing some words) and I had to see a doctor all the time,  so she can ask my mom how I've been doing in school. If I wasnt doing well, they would up the dose on my medication.. I think it was ritalin or something like that. I was almost left back in 7th grade, and I barely made it out of highschool. I tried to go to college (4 times), but always flunked out. Now, I get to watch everybody I graduated high school with go be succesful people. I just ran into an old friend, actually. He's an accountant in NYC. Another is now shooting music videos for an artist I wont tell, but you've heard of him/her.Now, I was lead here because I feel like I'm breaking down again. After 6 years working jobs I HATE, I thought I had it figured out. I decided on a whim I was going to take a flying lesson, and I was hooked. I started going back for more, and I actually started to take it seriously. I felt happy, and in control. Like everything was going to be okay. It gave me a break from my head for about a year. I studied for almost a year about weather, aircraft performance, how airplanes work, etc. I really, really wanted to be a pilot(scary, huh? I can't belive I actually thought that was going to happen..I feel humiliated that I even thought I could be a pilot..It was a good distraction though). I was in love with the idea. I have many books about planes, I watched every video on youtube,and I even got to fly solo in the airplane I was training in. Life was good. I was so happy I found what I  loved to do.Well, I just found out I wont be able to fly anymore because of a few disqualifying medical conditions (both mental and physical) and  I honestly feel I've been seriously crushed. I really feel that this was the tipping point for me. All the thousands of dollars I've spent. All the countless hours studing and putting my heart and my soul into flying.. all for nothing. Now I'm stuck at home, broke,  living with my parents, making almost minimum wage working a job I . On top of that, I cant keep a relationship. Every girl I ever get involved with loses intrest SO quick and bails. I'm severely under weight, everything is a mess and I really just don't have any energy left. I'm spent. I dont know how much longer I can stand to get out of bed and go to work. I just cant stop crying and thinking about how long it's going to be before I pull the trigger. I just feel like a pathetic, dumb person, and I honestly have NO reason to think otherwise. I have nothing to show for anything. It's hard to look anyone in the eye, because I just feel so embarassed to be me. I feel like actual scum.Now, its not immenent, I know that, because I refuse to kill myself in my parents home. That just aint right. I'd have to get a place of my own, sell my stuff, say goodbye to everyone for the last time, and check out. Thats gonna take some planning. I'm way too afraid to go see a therapist(I cant even make eye contact with another person) and I don't want to reach out to anyone. I don't think they would take it seriously/wouldnt understandI really dont know what I'm going to do. It's hell in my head, and I want out. In all seriousness, thinking about death is the only thing that brings me peace right now. This is the only place I felt comfortable talking about this. I'm sorry if I went off too much, but I needed to get it out.  All the best to all of you, and if you actually read this.. you da bomb",0
"Hey folks. I'm not sure how to format this so I'll just spew words here. It'll sound weird on account of my ADHD and struggle to communicate this stuff. I'll start this in saying that I do my best to make everyone smile. I never find myself smiling but I'll force one to help make others happy. I'll bust my ass to make sure someone feels better if they're down. I won't be overbearing about it, but I'll always be there for them. People liked me for my sense of humor and being quick on my feet with jokes. I was popular around the school for various reasons, some being my constant efforts to help people, my passion in my beliefs, my video gaming skills (yeah, not sure how that got me any points but it did lol), and my participation in politics and theatrical clubs. I would always fight to make sure everyone was happy or at least in a better situation than they were before. I'm told I give really good advice and helped people out. I'm in my senior year of high school. Something has changed. My upperclassmen friends are out of school and too busy to see me often. My in grade friends have pushed me out of their circles, not aggressively, but passively. Underclassmen just don't like me much. I used to have people regularly seek me out and talk to me. My girlfriend left me just a day or so ago, which made me realize how truly alone I was in the school without her. I reach out to people with lukewarm reception. The freshman are following the words of seniors who have never spoken to me and now I can hardly walk through any of their classes without getting called a faggot. Something to note about me is that I have ADHD. Combined with depression, it means my negative thoughts are constantly floating around my head. No distractions, just a constant flow of self loathing. It makes relaying my problems difficult and it makes it hard to seek help. I'm no stranger to suicide attempts, but I always stopped myself as of late because too many people relied on me. Well, now nobody relies on me. Wherever I try to make someone smile or help people feel better they are just bothered. Being a nuisance to people is one of the worst things I could ever be. I talk to people who I've been friends with for years and they're always coincidentally busy. Social media shows them out having a good time, and I know when to take a hint. It sounds like I'm some non-understanding asshole, but it's been a constant trend I've observed this year, even during all of summer. I've found out that I bother a lot of people and am just a general nuisance. People always just put up with me.I've got a lot of dreams. I want to be a politician (yeah, I know, I probably should be dead already with a dream like that.) and to change the country and perhaps even world into a better place. My end goal is to be a senator. I want to have as many people as I can in the country smile. I want to fight for what I believe in and make a positive impact.Well, after finding out I've been bothering everyone in my school this year in one way or another, the only positive impact I could probably make is a bullet in my head. Seriously, I don't know it I'm coming off like a selfish prick here , I'm trying to explain myself but I'm just typing words and they're all over the place. Goddamnit. I walk into school and other social functions and I realize. I finally realize what it's like to truly have  And that hurts beyond words for someone who's main goal is to make people happy. Hell, it hurts for anyone. College is going to be no different as it's in the same county. I've always been cruelly hard on myself. I never give myself credit. I am the first to help anyone, and last to help myself. When asked for positives on myself I find myself always wondering.As for my family , I've been a disappointment to them for years. I love my dad so much, and he works so hard, but I can't remember the last time he's complimented me or told me he was proud of me. Dead serious. My mom nearly bled to death having me when I was born, and I wish every day I could just give all of that back. She is always frustrated with me and I once overheard her talking to my older sister about how she worries if I'll succeed at all. My older sister is like a best friend to me. She and I always joke around and have great trust in one another. Now however, I've just been a thorn in her side. Shes clearly annoyed with me as of late. My little sister has autism. People make fun of her and I feel something my jolly, relaxed self never feels too often; genuine anger. She went to a summer camp this summer and told a counselor that her big bro was ""never there for her"". I fight hard to make sure she's safe in her first year of high school, but I fall woefully short. I'm the end of nearly every joke in the family and not taken seriously often. I've always been unnaturally good with animals and my dogs sleep on my bed every night. They follow me into every room and mirror my every motion. They nearly topple me every time I walk in. But I wonder if the two of them only like me because I'm the one that feeds them. If someone else had the job I'd be quickly forgotten probably.At work I'm not well liked, I always ask about things because I want to be sure the job is done well, despite the fact that I'm Essentially a garbage man for a grocery store. The church people tolerate me but only like my humor. I'm a nobody otherwise. I am a Christian and I hope Jesus still forgives me if I squander the gift he's given me, life. I never pray for myself, only for others.I'm not sure where I'm going with all of this. I'm usually so much more eloquent but I'm in school and just alone as all hell. The thoughts won't leave and I've lost so much ot my drive. I wish I could communicate this stuff better like I can communicate politics stuff for the school politics union. But instead I just sound like a ranting lunatic here. I've let everyone down as of late and can't make anyone happy like I used to. My upperclassmen buddies I mentioned are probably better off without the baggage of someone who is losing relevance fast and who's regularly just caused them issues. Really, I've probably done nothing of note for anyone no matter how hard I try. I don't tell people much about this as I don't want to be tossed into some institution. I'll end this with an apology, I'm sorry you guys had to read this nonsense. I'll probably be much more eloquent and make much more sense in the comments. I'm really sorry. EDIT: reading this over, it really is a bunch of gobbledygook. Nobody has to reply if it doesn't make enough sense. Sorry for the mess.",0
"Hey guys I just needed some advice and made a throw away because my ex knows my reddit account.Okay so me and my ex broke up about a month ago but we still talk everyday, we still have sex sometimes, and we also sometimes hang out (and it's a lot of fun, we laugh a lot!). He broke up with me because I just wasn't that good of a girlfriend and did some pretty mean things and things just didn't work out and he just needed space and didn't need my life in his hands (I threatened suicide many times in order to get him to stay with me, manipulative and shitty I know.. and I know better now). After a long time of crying and feeling suicidal myself I'm finally just okay about things between us. Today he told me he's been feeling so suicidal lately and the only reason he won't kill himself is because of his little sister. He feels so alone and feels like he has no real friends. His family sent his to a RTC for 2 years and he has this resentment towards his parents because they sent him away because he pissed dirty but not when he tried killing himself (so he knows it wasn't out of them caring about him). I told him so many times that I care about him and love him a lot still but he just doesn't feel it and believe it.In my communications class we learned about this thing called a ""love language"" and long story short he really only feels love through service (actions) and I really only feel love through affirming words. So for a long time we were just not sending love that is catered to each other because he would always show me but never really tell me and I would always tell him but never really show him. Okay so anyways, I want advice on how to show him I care and love him through actions, this was my first real relationship and i'm still rusty on what to do. I want him to not feel suicidal and depressed.
** How do you guys feel validated and loved through actions? what are some things people do that makes you feel good about yourself and life?  **I know this post probably belongs in the relationship subreddit but I would never go there for actual advice and him (and I) being suicidal just felt like this was a good place to go, since I OFTEN post here on my main account and I just feel so comfortable expressing myself here (but also I do delete my posts after my episode goes away)thank you ",1
"Hey guys,
This is just a vent type of post so sorry if I come across as annoying.As you may be able to tell from the title, I am committing ""suicide"" in every way besides actually doing the deed. I will not actually kill myself yet, as I am still living with my parents. I love them to death. They are the sole reason I have not hung/used an exit bag yet even though I have all of the materials. I'm 17, male, and pathetic. I would tell you guys why but it's kind of complicated and I think I explained it pretty well in my other posts (you could check them out on my profile if you'd like).Basically, I'm purposely sabotaging everything I have. It's a form of self punishment.Physical Sabotage:
I used to workout, but ever since I had a mental breakdown about sports and weightlifting, I have been eating just enough to survive. I do this to lose almost all my muscle mass and athleticism (for example, used to have 34"" standing vertical Jump, but now it is about 24"") by an extreme caloric deficit. I am working on becoming severely underweight, malnourished, and very weak to the point that walking is a chore. Basically imagine a skeleton with hair. I have not been drinking much water either, and am trying to stay in a steady state of dehydration (again, drinking just enough to stay alive). I never exercise and force myself, for example, to take the elevator instead of stairs. I know I am extremely lucky and fortunate to have a family that cares and access to all basic necessities, but I reject them all. I know I'm selfish and uncaring for doing these things but this is how much I hate myself. I've even though about getting rid of an arm or leg by making a deep gash into my skin then exposing the gash to infectious diseases. This would hopefully cause amputations. I still take showers and brush my teeth because I hate being a nuisance to other people by smelling or something. Otherwise, my body is a complete mess, rightfully so.Financial Sabotage:
I have a job in lawn care and make about 12.50/hr which is pretty good. For now I am keeping my job for only 2 reasons. Reason 1: I am saving money to ease the financial troubles my family is going through (divorce and both parents have low income). Reason 2: All the money left over I donate because I don't deserve any of it.
I feel better when I have no money in my wallet because I know that's what is right for me.Educational Sabotage:
I am a pretty good student. 4.65 GPA and 32 ACT/12 ACT Writing. That's great and all but this year, senior year, I am purposely trying to tank my grades. I am trying to get all Cs or Ds so I can barely pass. I like to see myself fail tests and assignments. Even if I know the answers I still choose the wrong ones. My grades and ACT are from freshman-junior year, when I used to be ambitious and attempting to get into University of Pennsylvania. That dream is gone. I do not want to be successful. It's not worth anything. So, since I have an ""all or nothing"" mindset, I am choosing ""nothing.""Relationship Sabotage:
This one is probably the least effective on me. I don't have many friends but the ones that I do have, I am breaking ties with. I do things to make them think that I'm a very mean and selfish person. I sometimes talk back to my teachers to make them think lowly of me as well.  I still try to do the best for my parents by taking care of them and faking happiness so they can be happy (I don't know if it's working, I don't care). They have done so much for me, I want to return the favor even if it's not sincere.So this is it guys. I'm methodically ruining my life so suicide isn't that extreme when the time comes. I'll wait it out until I am as distant as I've ever been to my parents (read: halfway across the world with minimal contact) in order to end it. Now is not the right time. I just wanted to thank you guys so much for reading this far, if you have. It means a lot to me. Usually I write better but I have a time limit and I'm typing on the road at each stoplight. So there are many breaks in my writing. I will see you guys tomorrow. No suicide here, just eternal suffering :).",1
"Hey guys. I recently got exposed as a catfish online and it was true, I faked my identity. I lied to so many people, even got into two relationships. What started as boredom, turned to curiosity, then obsession. I loved the new identity I made for myself; I had wanted to escape my own. I tend to have such negative, unhealthy thoughts. Suicide crosses my mind daily because of the constant guilt. Everytime I would push myself to tell the truth, my heart would feel as though it would drop into my stomach. I don't think anyone could forgive me. I know I sound like a whiner, I know I need to move on and focus on reality, but this has got me really down. I just feel so sorry for all that I had hurt because of my want to feel like I belonged somewhere in the world.",1
"hey- i heard of this community and i thought id try to talk here to see if anyone could help me? anyways

"Hey reddit, I have a problem with my girlfriend and for some context, we're both in high school.Last night, my girlfriend asked me if I have ever been suicidal. I have never, but I immediately felt concerned because I knew where the conversation was heading. She revealed to me that she has been suicidal before. I asked if she ever self-harmed and she told me she has considered it. She said that 3 years ago, she felt alone, she had a pair of scissors, and was thinking about stabbing herself in the stomach at the moment. When she told me this I just gave her a big hug and told her that she can always talk somebody and she could talk to me if she ever needed to. I honestly didn't know what else to say because we were out on a date and I didn't want to upset her by saying something she might not like. Even now as I write this, I recall her telling me that when she was in elementary, she threatened her schoolmates that were bullying her that she would kill herself. At the time when she told me this, I was shocked, but rationalized in my mind that she was probably lying so her bullies would back off. She said it in a kind of laughing tone and I assumed (stupidly) that she was all right. She exhibits some signs of depression. She asked me if my parents hated her after they met her and she has a pretty low image of her body.This is where I need some advice. I really want to help her out because I really, really like her and would never leave her because of something like this. I've been reading some of the stuff on  but I'm not sure when/how to approach the subject. Do I just wait for her to bring this up again or should I offer her a chance to talk to me more about this before something serious ever happens? Thanks in advance.",1
Hey so I have SA a lot of it when I think I've hurt someones feelings or done something embarrassing I just want to die now a lot of people say ohh I wanna dieee but I actually do I hate dealing with some drama I had with someone I would rather just die and not deal with it ever again but there's often times where I'm so happy in alive night car rights or hanging with friends doing whatever but ive been thinking about wanting to be dead almost everyday I won't ever do it but its getting out of hand how much SA can effect me,1
"Hey SW, my girlfriend yesterday attempted suicide by OD with pills, what do I do and say?",1
"Hey there bud, sorry if your going through a rough time, I myself have been going through a couple of few months. To start I lost my little sister, she was 25 and apparently she was a drug addict which no one foresaw. I am left with her 4 year old son to raise as my own as I raised her( I'm only 28). At first I couldn't live with myself but as time went on, I realized I'm still here for a reason that reason being him. There is a lot to live for and you'll figure yours out when it comes. Before I would contemplate everyday in which way I would go out like you, now I'm 6 months without one single thought through my mind. I do not know you nor do I know anything about you but I can assure you that what ever you are going through it will pass my friend. And one day you will look back and be thankful you didn't do it because like me I gained a son and now I have all to live for, and one day you'll have yours just give it time to find your calling. Best wishes my friend god bless",1

"Hey, I'm just a 12 year old kid and I feel super suicidal. I just want to get out of the godforbidden shit-shack called school. 
I have a best friend, but every time I try to hang out with him, he sees his other best friend and I instantly become a third wheel. He says that we likes us both the same but it is just so obvious that he likes him more than me. 
I keep telling my parents that I want to be homeschooled and they say, ""it's not what is best for you."" 
I was searching ways to kill myself quickly and painlessly on the internet and my mom saw my history and she told me dad. That was the night I was going to end it all. My dad called on his way to work and called my mom. (They are divorced which is one of the reasons I'm so depressed, but at least thy are still friends). My dad started texting me and my mom talked to me about it. The way they were so upset and crying and begging me to not take actions is one of the reasons I'm holding back with every fiber in my body. 
My sister was all of a sudden so much nicer to me, so Im pretty sure my parents told her. 
I have an appointment in about a week but I don't know if I will live to see it. :( 
My dogs are so happy and sweet. I love my dogs, sister, and parents the same. I love baseball and I'm very talented at it, which is one of the reasons I don't pull the trigger everyday. 
I spend a lot of time with my dad and we are basically best friends. I would love to spend more time with my mom, but she is depressed too and she gets upset and angry very often. I am always worried my parents will be disappointed or my sister will make fun of me if I bring home a C or lower. 
I almost killed my self with a cord earlier today and I had it tight around my neck for  about 3 seconds when somewhere deep down inside told myself to stop what I'm doing and calm down. 
I hate school so much and my parents always think I'm being bullied, but the truth is, I'm not. I'm just like every other kid who hates schools, but just to a way higher degree of hatred and despise toward the damned place. I don't even cuss a lot but this subject just pisses me off so much. I'm loved by many people who I know would be upset. 
The thing is, I always want to commit sluiced but every chance I get, I don't even though I could spare myself of the years of torture to come with just 10-30 seconds. 
I'm never happy anymore and even when doing things I love I'm not happy and I just want to not be depressed and not hate school with so much anger and despair. 
I also have Tourette Syndrome which I don't think helps the situation.

"Hey, lately i having been down, sad and suicidal. I plan on ending my life in a few days due to my reasons i shall say. 1. My first problem would that im lonely, i want a girlfriend, someone i can hold by my side when im sad. Someone to talk about video games and anime. I feel lonely while ALL my friends are out kissing and fucking random girls im here beating off and sobbing in my bed. I can make girls laugh and be my best friends but they never want to date. girls say im cute. I hate having dreams about a girl and  we dating to wake up and realize the spot on my bed that she should be is cold. :(. 2. Im starting grade 10 in 2 days. All friends and family say imma love it, but i dont known anybody (New school). Its a trend to be a dart boi (Canadian fuck bois, smokes cigarettes but they call them darts) (i smoke occasionally but am a skater) 50%  are nice 50% are dicks. Last year dart bois LOVED me. But i cant be bothered getting in trouble with police for breaking a guys arm in a fight again, lol. 3. I hate how my life is plane boring . 4. I made a post a while ago. ",0

"Hey,So I've been pretty low this year and it appears to be getting worse. I've never struggled with feelings like this until this year - in fact I've been fortunate enough to be an incredibly happy person - but due to many issues in every area of my life all happening at once, I think about how low I am and how I can 'get out of it' very often.A few days back I started writing a suicide note for my sister. She doesn't know what I've been going through and I began to explain the terrible year I've had. Then I got to the point where I was telling her why I was leaving this note for her and not my mother or any of my friends. I believed she'd find it in her to understand and forgive me more than anyone else. I just kept writing and writing until I had a dissertation sized note and I broke down, cried, then stopped writing. I had no plan of how I was going to end it but I hoped I'd have it in me to finish the note and go and do it one way or another.Right now, I'm on the train down to London for a week of writing sessions. I'm a songwriter/producer for a living and will be in the room with many high profile writers, some of which have written for the likes of Frank Ocean, Kendrick Lamar, John Newman, Kylie Minogue etc etc. Not that these names matter, but I want to emphasise how I'm really not in the right headspace for this and I feel so fragile and inferior right now. It's a feeling I've become familiar with this year but I just have no idea how this is going to go when suicide is so frequently on my mind. Stress of this level is not what I feel like I need right now but I can't get out of it.I don't know what I'm expecting by writing this on here, but I felt like I needed to do it.Thanks for reading.",1
Hey. I have been thinking about suicide for the past few days.,1
Hey. I need help to find a good way to die.,1
"Hey. I've always ignored how much I thought about suicide in the past. Most recently I decided to pay attention and ended up realizing that I think at least a couple times a day what would life be without me; how the life of my loved ones would move forward, which way I'd choose to go.My family is very strict about this subject  my uncle commited suicide about 11 years ago and almost no one ever talked about it  and talking to them about what I'm feeling will just cause unnecessary pain and concern.On the other hand, I've been with this girl for the past 8 months and it's been great. We've never talked about depression or suicide specifically but I've mentioned a few times how fucked up my life was/can be. Having her around is great and, honestly, one of the few things that I really enjoy lately, though she's gonna study abroad for a year (yeah, that's messing me up a bit, but anyway).I just wanna know if I should talk to her about it and how I can do it so that she doesn't feel guilty. Will it help me? Will it fuck up our relationship?I'm afraid that those intrusive thoughts will escalate into something more real, more intense. ",1
"Hey. So I think about killing myself a lot. I won't kill myself, since I know what kind of pain that would inflict on those around me. I also don't think it's worth it to distance myself from those people before killing myself as it'd cost a lot of time and effort, and when they'd find out they'd still be hurt.But I feel zero motivation to live. The only things I do in life are to serve others, to ease their time in the world. I have a job that keeps me occupied a few days a week. Sometimes I hang with friends. I'll read, watch stuff, and play games occasionally, but this is me trying to pass the time, it feels like chores. Same thing with sports, or even eating. I don't feel motivated to care much for myself, although I do eat healthy as I don't want to be too much of a burden on this planet either.I feel like I'm a burden a lot. I let a lot of friendships go without attention, but those friends don't seem to mind that either. When I do spend time and energy it's somewhat appreciated but there doesn't seem to be a lot of will to reciprocate.Maybe I'm annoying to them or otherwise rather avoided by people. Maybe I don't show how shitty I feel about life in general. I don't know.I've come here to ask what you think there is to live for. I think we as humans cause so much harm to everything and everyone around us, inadvertently or not, that it's better to not exist.",1

Hi all. 14 y/o boy who just fucked his whole life up.,1
"hi all. just want to say i'm entirely new to reddit. literally spent 10+ minutes trying to figure out how to use this web but I just wanna share what's going through my head right now (and maybe seek some opinions?).first of all, i have been contemplating about death along with passive suicidal thoughts for a considerably long amount of time now + depression + anxiety. recently, i realized that i'm just way too tired for all these any more. the daily struggle to fight against these thoughts and survive weights me down so much to the point where i have made the decision to just drop every thing i care about.i was keen on recovering/overcoming/adapting with my mental illness before but as of now, i have entirely stopped my medications. the only pill i really take now is my sleeping pills since sleeping takes so much lesser effort to live. everyday is spent waiting for my brain to get worse and hoping that one day, i would have a reason + motivation to turn my passive suicidal thoughts to active ones. plans have been made, dates have been set, time has been considered. everything is set except for that one final probe.i have slowly cut off most of my relationship with others (family, friends, any humans) ever since depression started and now, i'm cutting off my inner circle of friends too who(m) i have shared my problems with. work wise (which i can't leave due to some reasons), i have began to erase my existence by slowly fading out of everyone's life. i cleared all my stuff from my desk and now it's almost an entirely brand new desk. i longed for one day where i can just disappear and not having any one to remember for because i don't want to affect any one. i don't want any one to have ""oh I had this one friend that committed suicide"" part of their lives. there is nothing that bounds me from this world any more. not friends, not family, not any thing. i cant emphasize how tired i am and there is no words to explain exactly how i am feeling now. i don't consider about my future at all since i actually did plan to end my life off at this ""certain age"" which ultimately, i didn't due to the lack of the final probe i mentioned. it feels like i have been over-living since i have no other plans after that ""certain age"" of mine but thinking about my future triggers my anxiety so much that i'll just drop whatever i am doing and become a small black hole of despair and misery. therapy and professional help wise, i have gone for lots of them but now, i have only one psychologist that is really helping and also the one who(m) i am brutally honest with. he knows everything that i have typed so far and i'm extremely lucky to have someone willing to pull me out of my drowning thoughts. but like i said, i gave up. i gave up holding on to life and i have closed off that option of receiving help from him or any one in fact. i don't feel guilty at all for i'm a selfish being.don't worry (if any one actually cares and if you do, i appreciate it) because my planned dates aren't exactly near yet unless my brain one day decides to push everything forward and ruin my detailed plan.i'm seeking opinion of what the community thinks of my situation. maybe something might probe me away from the suicide path or even further into it. whatever works, i honestly don't care which direction i go any more.i thank any one in advance if i don't reply immediately (i have no idea how to use reddit) for any replies that may appear here and i apologize if this is something you are not interested in.",1
"Hi anonymous crowd,recently, I have been contemplating suicide again and this time I feel like those thoughts are becoming more harder to dispel. Therefore, I wanted to ask you guys for your thoughts. Here are my considerations:I don't think I can ever find a job because based on past experience, colleauges and bosses don't get along with me, can't stand having me around after a while. Also, I am socially awkward and don't like being around people, unless I am really close to them. I am currently a student, but I am failing my courses because I am depressed again. I can't help it and I feel desperate. My conclusion is that I am unfit for life. I cannot support myself and I hate the thought of being financially dependent on my mother, a girlfriend (which I dont have) or society for the rest of my life. So I think I should end it now because there is no other rational solution.
Meds don't work and therapy doesnt work either. Even if I will be better in the future, it will recur, as it always has, and whatever I am engaged in at that point will collapse. I cannot achieve anything because I am unreliable due to my mental instability. The only real problem I have with killing myself is the grief it would bring upon my family and the few people who care about me. But should I stay alive and eke out a living just to avoid aggrieving them? I'm not sure. Maybe I can convince them that it is the only way and the best thing in the long run. I dont wanna whine here about how horrible I feel and how depression destroys my life, I am only interested in pragmatic approaches in dealing with it. Since I have tried meds and therapy, I don't believe in it anymore, as it has never helped me. I do not wanna live like this forever, it is unworthy and pointless. I am only a burden to society and that is unacceptable to me. I don't wanna stick around just to feel worthless and failed. The next question would be how to do it, but I guess first things first. So, considering there is no cure and I am a burden, wouldnt it be reasonable to end myself? Let me know what you think. Thanks!

"Hi guys! It's me, the smart ass! At least, that's what my Dad/youth pastor calls me. I've made multiple posts here as , but that account got banned so... after much thinking, I've decided I'm going to kill myself. The reasons why should be in the link to my main account, but the main reasons are my school and my parents (steriotypical for a 12 yr old, I know). I literally have nothing to hold me up, any support structure I did have my Dad is taking away. So I guess this is the end of the road y'all. My name was Lathan Armogida. I used to love acting, sports, and my friends. When I was 5, I said I would kill myself the day before I turned 13. I didn't really mean it, I just didn't want to become a yucky teenager. But yet here I am, prepping for my 13th birthday on October 1st, wanting to die. It makes too much sense.",1

"Hi I'm not going to share my name but I'm a college student who's going to graduate very soon and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Originally I wanted to be an English teacher, but I didn't get into my college's teaching program since my co-op teacher didn't give me a fair chance. She was looking for flaws from the second I walked into the room, I honestly don't think there was anything I could have done. After it happened I decided that I would just pursue my English degree and learn how to be happy with just that. I knew I was lying to myself, but now I know for sure that I regret that decision. I wanted to be a teacher because I saw it as a way to help people, people like me, people who suffer. Helping people is the only thing I've ever been passionate about in my entire life, and an English degree won't help me do that. I've looked at the options for what a person with an English degree can do and none of them mean anything to me. Any idiot can edit a paper, any idiot can write an article. I won't be making a difference, so what's the point? I could have changed my major, but I didn't want to put my family through that, I'm already in debt and they've been helping me pay and if I were to change it, it would have only caused them more debt and more grief. Sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't just end it now and get it over with.",1
"Hi I'm not really sure if this is the right place to ask this but here I go.Very long post ahead.
Advanced sorry for the shitty formatting.So I'm currently with a girl (we havent been together for long) and this is the happiest time of my life so far. I'm dead set on making this work. At the beginning I thought that if this fails, I'll never go for a relationship again but it turned into something worse. I'd literally choose her over everything. Every outcome I aim for is literally for our relationship and time together(or so i'd like to think) .I was a bit depressed and a bit suicidal before we got together. Just a bit. No actual acts involved. Though I was thinking very hard to go to a therapist because I felt I was going down that sad inevitable path.Now I realized that I became fully dependent to her. There were times we came close to a breakup and my thoughts were only zeroing in to suicide. Like there was never another option but that.She's nice but sometimes she'd like to mess with me (not very serious) but sometimes because of anxiety and trust issues I'd take it seriously but she still won't stop. (for instance I asked who's this guy then she'd answer in a manner that'd make anyone think there's something between the lines).Sometimes it leads to an endless cycle of fight that would end up with me apologizing like I'm begging for my life. Because I probably am.A hint of cheating(although unlikely) from her would also give me attacks of ""those"" thoughts. And it' d be enough to keep me wide awake until it gets resolved somehow. We havent fought for a time now. And I'm desperately fighting to keep it this way and fortunately there hasnt been anything weird hsppening lately but it's inevitable. I just want to make sure that I'll make it through next time. With her fortunately. In my current state, I probably wont last 3 weeks without talking to her. I'd be dead by the end of the 2nd week. I'm wish I am joking but I have enough anger and sadness to push myself from a high place when I'm at a really bad place. (almost seriously did it once. Stood on top of a footbridge for almost two and a half hours. The only thing that kept my feet on the ground was the fact that she hadn't broken up with me yet but was very close to doing so) Everything my life is depends on this relationship right now. I have a lot of hobbies but nothing makes anything work in me when we're fighting. Even the things I love the most turns into nothing when we're fighting. I'm paralyzed. So basically, I want to be less dependent. For the sake of both of us. Having someone commit suicide because of you is kind of traumatic(at least for me).If she ever breaks up with me, i want to last a bit longer than two weeks. She may get convinced that she's not the reason or something. I dont know. Im a mess. I dont even have a reason for writing this right now. I just think I should. Having to live without her is something I can never do at this point. This is the cringiest thing ive ever written but I have no other way of asking for help. ",1
"Hi reddit. I'll just start by saying that english isn't my native language, so dont get caught up in my grammar mistakes. This is going to be a long post, but i hope someone will take their time to read all of it, it would mean a lot to me. Im not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this either, but here goes.I am a 20 year old guy who just started at university, about two weeks now to be exact. The school is my countrys best school in the field of economics, a study I wasn't sure if fits me, but I've always kind of liked math, so I thought ""Hell, I'll try and see how it goes"".Since I was a kid and started at school, I've always had a lot of friends, I was good at sports, popular with the girls, overall a pretty good and safe childhood.
It's in the last weeks I have come to realize to myself that i have some pretty deep, bad, mental issues.I consider myself a pretty introverted guy, so moving away from my hometown to a new city where i knew nobody, felt like a huge change for me. I have always kind of tried to avoid social situations where I might feel uncomfortable, like talking in front of a crowd or being the center of attention. I choke, I start to stutter, and worst; I sweat. I do not know why, but it starts with a few
drops on my forehead and escalates to entire head and forehead. This is an evil spiral, I become aware that I am sweating and knows that the person/people I am talking to notice it, making me more uncomfortable and nervous, wanting to just run away from
the situation. That's one of the main reasons why I try to avoid uncomfortable social situations.Another problem is my conversational skills. Talking to someone I don't know well or feel uncomfortable around, I can't keep up a normal conversation. I keep thinking not to fuck up and say something stupid, and I keep thinking 'What would be smart to say, what's a clever thing to say now', and I end up being so unconcentrated that I can't hear what the other person is talking about, fucking up the conversation. This makes me stressed like hell, and in most cases I begin to sweat. That's when the panic shoots, I know I now seem like a retard in front of everyone.So these two last weeks has completely crushed my self esteem, I am now in a place where I don't feel like life is worth living anymore. All day, any place I walk, I am thinking 'Please don't start sweating and make a fool of yourself', because I care immensely what people think of me. It sounds stupid,
I've tried getting over this, but I can't. It has come to a point where I have realized that whatever I do in life,
I will always be that socially awkward guy who sweats and stresses out. This has made me realize that whatever I plan doing,
I will not be able to relax and enjoy life, a torture I can't live with.The reason I just can't kill myself is that I love my family so much..Killing myself would break their hearts, so I can't get myself to do this... I've always considered suicide as a selfish act if you leave behind someone who cares about you, even if you think it's the only way out. So my other alternative
is to run away. I enjoy my own company, and running away into the woods or someplace in this world where I could be alone and still be able to contact my family  in a way seems like the best way for me to go right now. I have a budget of about 13 000 USD, so I guess that could get me somewhere.
I guess another option could be to get a job where I avoid being in contact with a lot of people, so I could hide my social fear.Right now I am just lost and depressed, I can't focus so I've fallen behind on every subject at school, only thinking about what I am going to do with my life. Because the way it is now, its not worth living. I guess im writing this here in hope that someone who has been in a similar situation could come with some advice, or just someone I could talk to.. if there are any pills or drugs I could take to help me get over my social anxiety, or make me stop sweating, it would be a great help.
Thank you for reading this.",1
"Hi there. A few months back now, the start of June, I went on holiday for what was meant to be a fun great time with my friends. There was plenty of drinking maybe too much stupidly and one night my heart was racing, eyes couldn't focus and my brain felt foggy. Ever since that night it has been there 24/7. I have something wrong with me but doctors say all my tests are clear. My short term memory is awful and I can't remember anytjing. I just feel numb and in pain. I can't run without being out of breath after 10 seconds. What gets me is I loved life. I loved it dearly and had so many aspirations. But now it's all over because of one stupid mistake. I would of killed myself by now if i wasnt worried id fuck it up and because of my family. My life is a living hell and a utter nightmare. I just want to be able to function like a normal human. Things will never be the same again and it's tragic because I am a goos and nice person. I try to be the best person I can and I get this? Why me? What did I do to deserve this.",1

"Hi, I guess... I don't know how to do this. I posted in depression but maybe I should've posted here...?I've been depressed for nearly 6 years now, and you know it has been worse (suicidal) and slightly better. There was a time for a couple months I thought that maybe life was worth living but it came crashing down again. And I can't realy blame myself, I wasn't worth enough to have such feelings. I don't think I ever was.So I guess when reflecting and talking to my sister we had a pretty sad childhood and got lots of problems still lingering from it. And one of my firends when we were out at a pub, he's been my friend for like 12 years now, he said about my father ""I can understand why he remaried with someone with children, cause he knew he'd fucked up with you and wanted to try/start over again"". And I guess that is true cause all he did was to put my sister and I infront of the TV or computer. Though my mother wasn't that good either she put me infront of a book (good, made me scary litterate as a kid) but she always had a bad temper. Like a hellish scream I never heard before. And she's very controlling. So that wasn't that great either. Both had to work alot to get things going for them so I guess I didn't really spend that much quality time with my family. So I waited for my time to leave and then moved out, and today I try to never visit home because I always feel bad when I'm there.And I have been kinda suicidal lately. I remember someone asked me if I was ok and only slept bad. I kinda then proceeded to do as I always do and push those asking away. I don't want to and actually would like to talk with that person about how I feel but I think it's not right. I think I will try and talk with her about something but I don't know how to ask...How should I bring it up that I want to talk about something? Should I do that? Won't they be bothered and worried which is worse than not knowing? Worse than to be surprised than me taking my life, and not knowing or believing that they could or would do anything. Is it right to burden others with the weight of your thoughts? Especially since you meet them and word could spread?I wish I could cry in front of someone and be hugged. I wish I could talk to my friend and tell her how I feel and that I need someone to talk to, but I'm not quite sure she could take it or help me. Is it ok to talk to someone? Is it ok to share what I feel like, looking for some sort of comfort? Can I find comfort in this by talking or will I just ruin everything and risk having her never talk to me again, can I risk talking to anyone about this? Is it right of me to press something on someone, is it right to ever make someone possibly feel what I am feeling and my suicidal thoughts?",1

"Hi, i need help. We kinda had a fight today (actually she was just emotionally unstable) and she threw this info to me for the first time ever. After that, i started to think about the hints she gave me and felt stupid because i didnt catch. I told her to tell me everything she feels about it from now, and that all her fights are mine too. She also told me that sometimes she cuts herself in the shower, and this has been happening since shes a kid, and that the only reason she didnt killed herself yet, is because of me.

"Hi, I posted here a month ago, things gotten better after that but now shit is coming back. Im 19 years old, failed to pass high school for 2 years and now following a program for adults. I regret alot these days, telling me how I could have gotten out of school with a diploma 2 years ago if studied properly. I set my sight on a college I wanted to apply after I highschool but now I'm stuck at this program for 2 more years. The regret builds up, I read about going to college at the age of 21 is normal but thinking of spending 2 years here just make me depressed. People I know, acquantainces even people I call friends are studying at univerisity or higher education. And by the time I get out of school, others are already graduated. It makes me feel pitiful. I have to wake up at 6 every day to take buses. Winter is coming and its a struggle to get up. I find its hard to get motivated to study. I get home late everyday, home is not soothing either. I met old classmates today and talked to them. They said they were at university makes me feel super bad to look at them and keep up the with conversation. I dont know what to do anymore. I want to study and get good grades so that I can get out asap. But the thoughts of being kept there for 2 years makes the study unmotivating. I feel tired, this is my last chance at school, if I fcked this up even my first year, I'm done for, mentally and physically. Going to school keeps making me think about mistakes I made in the past and I feel angry with myself all the time. Please talk to me, enlighten me, guide me, I really feel a big burden of the past mistakes and the upcoming challenges. ",1
"Hi, I've never really posted on reddit except once before so I don't really know what I'm doing... My fiance is on here all the time so I figured I'd give it a shot to talk to someone, anyone. I'm 18, just turned 18 this year and at 17 my mom pushed me to go to cosmetology school.. I had graduated early and she wanted me to get my life started Blah Blah. I was depressed already, but agreed and here starts my shit journey with this school and everyone in it. It's the cheapest cosmetology school that was near me at the time(I live an hour and some change away now. But still have to go woohoo!) The teachers are a JOKE.. I am free labor I'm not taught anything I'm supposed to be I know I'm gonna fail my state board test because of this and I only have a few months left.. Anyways! This isn't just about the school I just. I'm venting because I have nothing else to talk about in a way idk what to say ughhh. Sorry, So as a kid I was depressed always from the age of 5 my uncle's pal molested/raped me until I was like.. 13(?) Maybe longer, honestly everything blurred together now.. he threatened my younger sister if I ever told anyone and threatened to hurt my mom etc.etc. in school i never had any friends ever, might sound like ""pff well everyone has at least one friend"" no, I had none.. ever if I ever started to get a friend I got really clingy and overly attached and they'd eventually abandon me or start bullying me like everyone else. People at school would cut me burn me rip out hair /cut hair step on my feet. In gym class I had to do wall pushups in this awful little ledge thing and I had the senior T.A kick my feet off the wall and the rest of the class laughed.. in p.e another time we had to do a run called the cross country run. You literally had to run up a huge mountain that was connected to a large main road and through a dry riverbank. Etc, well a man who at the time i assumed was an older student (he had a school jacket on) assaulted me. I realize now he was just a random man that probably watched the school and learned our days for this track. I hid this from everyone and got severely depressed started selfharming and trying to drown myself. My parents found this out YEARS later and forced me to go to a shrink and the police. I had to go through private exams and i felt extremely violated. Later resulting in having a HUGE Panic attack and my dad threatening to punch me in the face. Then me getting put into a hospital overnight and treated like a test subject by my family. School got worse, I failed everything and eventually my mom put me in a new school. This new school wasn't a normal school it was a homeschool with on campus classes.. Anyway I met a guy who was 5 years older than me and we eventually dated. I wouldn't have sex with him, SOO! He drugged me at a party took advantage of me with his cousin and video taped IT WOOHOO! This became blackmail. I dated him a little over a year after that my mom eventually ripped me out of school as she saw I was getting more and more depressed (my mom is no saint in all this. She was verbally and mentally abusive to me and just me. Same with my dad. And my little sister was the Angel in the family.) And I started failing yet again. Zach (fake name of my now ex boyfriend) got pissed at this and spread the video more than he ever had before. It was all over everything.  My parents took everything away. Phone, computer, tv, outside, my music my d's. Everything I was so depressed I didn't eat anything for months. . I finished all my school stuff asap after all this. Was done around 15/16. Then Met my now fiance who is the best, he is perfect. I'm moved out of my house now and with him and life is better right? Wrong, everything hurts I'm constantly feeling self conscious about EVSRYTHING. It doesn't help that he is REALLY bad with his computer. He is on it 24/7 for his school and his work and his games or his videos or his Reddit or this or that. He looks at his computer more than he looks at me. In the beginning of our relationship he ignored me constantly for this stupid fucking game. And I almost killed myself so many times during that time period. I know I'm babbling and I'm sure none of this makes sense but I'm constantly fuxking sad. I love him I love my life now I have a bunch of animals 11... now.. lol! I have loving grandparents.. I'm getting married! But I'm sad, life has caught up to me. My school is making me miserable. My past is hurting my present and my future and I feel like I'm slowly slipping. Well.. quickly slipping I guess.. I still don't have friends, I don't drive don't have a job. We live off a very fixed income. I don't have tampons when I need em (not his fault.. but I know they cost quite a bit. So I never ask.) I am living, eating, breathing..getting what I need. I am in a happy enviroment i laugh and i have a loving soon to be husband and some loving family. But I'm so sad.. I'm sorry guys idk if anyone will evsn read or answer this.. how do you answer this?? I'm just sad.. ive attempted suicide a handful of times. Ive drank windex and taken pills my mom had.

"Hi, thanks for reading my last words.I'm only 18 almost 19 and my life is about to end. What a shit life I've had. Yes, many have had worse but they are not me. Fuck, my family thinks I'm going the shop and will be back in about 20 mins. Guess I won't be. Don't know why I turned out like I did, ugly, pathetic and weird, well I must be weird because I have no friends and never had a girlfriend. I never fit in with anyone. You might hear this on the local news around Newcastle. I'm sorry if you do, but just think I'm finally at peace and then smile.I'm gonna jump now.Thanks,

"Hi. My story is rather simple. I am 24 years old and have always been unlucky, and failure. I have also been used as a laughing stock many times, in my group of ""friends"". That is the purpose I have served. I am not sure that I want to continue is this is all that life has to offer me. Few months ago, I went to travel with my friends, not a big trip, just a one day trip. And I kept being subject of all the jokes. It felt like I was being harassed or bullied. I feel like this is not meant to be happening now, I mean we are in 20s we are not in 8th grade anymore. But it happened, and it felt terrible.This is one of the event, but I have always been an outcast, all my life, always been laughed at. I have embarassed myself, people have ridiculed me. It has been an embarrassing life. I just feel like I can't do it anymore.I love my parents and they have showered me with love all my life. So I feel torn.Also, I have bipolar disorder, have failed two colleges, used to be an engineering major, but now doing some easy arts courses in a shitty college just to get a degree. I am about to graduate in like 8-9 months. But my degree is embarrassing, I have terrible score, and I am not getting employed either after graduation. And, quite funnily, I don't know whether I am even functional enough to work.Good thing about my life is that, I was born in a fairly wealthy family, so I am not worried about poverty or anything.Also, in few years I would be arranged married, and I just hate the idea of it. I mean what if I just completely hate the person? What if the person hates me? It is basically marrying a stranger. And the people I have met in my current college, I just can't get along with them at all, what if she is one of such person?.Also, I am supposed to not tell them about my illness, but it will eventually come out, and sometimes people even want a divorce when they realize they have been lied to in arranged marriages. It is the number one reason for divorce in India, I read in an article. But on the other hand, if I tell them that I have mental illness, they will interpret it as me saying ""I am crazy!!! I am lunatic"" and they will cancel it and not give me a chance. So I would feel like I am duping someone into something.It is just a terrible feeling of not experiencing and exploring what ""love"" is but just marrying a stranger. It will just be something that happens in TV.I spend like 7-8 hours easily on the internet, feeling guilty about it, feeling like I am just wasting my life. Have not been able to study since 21 days. Just not been able to motivate myself to sit and open a book and study. Have tried but just not been able to do it.Now I don't know if I want to continue living this life of hermit. No friends, no love, no work, terrible education, mental illness.",1

"Hi.
A friend of mine is going through a ridiculously hard time at the moment, she isn't eating or drinking and feels alone. I have had to talk her out of killing herself so many times already and I don't know how many more times she's going to listen to me. The problem here is that we live hours away from each other so I can literally only help her over a phone. What can I do? She literally has no one to talk to apart from me.",1
"Hi.. I want to commit suicide. But not really. I just got bored of life. Existence is pain.
Let's unload the cards.I'm an 18yo old male, gay (not out), only child in a disintegrating family.
Pretty depressed, anxious, introverted, nihilistic, melancholic.
Having mental breakdowns usually couple times per week
and thinking about suicide almost every day.
Going to sleep with a wish of not waking up.Still student. In a school i hate and i can't see myself having a 9-5 job.
I hate routines and I'm anti-social most of the time.
Haven't been in a relationship yet. Don't wanna be, thanks to self-hatred.
I see myself too much as a complex and unlovable person.
And i don't wanna hurt anybody.My family now basically consist only of my mother and grandma.
My mother have a really low self-confidence and self-esteem
and is under medication because she have some kind of mental illness.
My grandma is .. just normal stereotypical grandma.
Conservative and living alone.I have two close friends. One of them is my classmate. He mentally bullied me
over some period of time in elementary school but we became friends later.
I still don't know how i was able to forgive him when he was ordinarily making me cry.
But i did and he changed. I think he would take a bullet for me and i would do the same.
I would do the same for anybody, because i love other people.
I see others worth, but not myself.
For example, i just recently registered myself as a bone marrow donor to feel more ""useful"".I care about myself to a certain extent. I don't do drugs, i don't smoke, i don't drink
and I'm not promiscuous, like my peers.
I even started to do sports, to get rid of depression, at least for a while,
but it didn't last forever
I don't wanna have a long life. I'm not interested in having a job to make money and
being materialistic (i would like to, but i don't see purpose in it).
Or having a relationship or other deeper bond,
because i don't see purpose in it. Nothing is forever.
Maybe it will change when something happens. And it will not because i will still be who i am.
Bullshit. I'm having a little inner conflict. I see myself as a shitty person. That's why.
My friend recently asked me, just out of curiosity, if there's someone in a world I really
hate. Only person that came up in my head was myself, but i said nobody.I guess I'm not able to off myself normally. I thought about drinking to death
(since i don't drink at all, it would be interesting experience)
but that's not happening.
Because there are still people out there, that would be devastated by my death.
My mother, grandma and friends.
So i can only wish. And i still didn't let depression to take a full control over me.
But it's making it's own way up since i started thinking about more ways to overcome my
self-preservation instinct and emotional barriers. I just somehow accepted that
i will kill myself eventually in a future. I'm also often thinking about doing something heroic,
like saving someone's life somehow. Sacrifice myself.
So I'm stuck in this vicious circle. Thinking about doing something stupid and on the other side
knowing what should i do and what i shouldn't do. Something is still working right in my head i guess.I thought about other non self-destructive methods of getting my sh#t together.
Like talking to therapist or someone. But I'm not much talkative in person
and i wouldn't describe my problem as exactly as i did now, when I'm writing it.
I'm nerd, let's be honest.
And i would not take any medications. I have standards. That's related to my aversion
against alcohol, drugs, cigarettes and similar. I want to keep my body clean.
Another way i thought about is to get into some kind of relationship drama.
Having someone closer. Maybe i would get some confidence and experience.. I'm lonely.
Whatever. Nevermind, that's not happening, who would like a person that hates himself.
And I'm even pushing away my current friends
because i don't want them to see me as I am now. I would be rude and detached.
I also tried to channel my bad thoughts and depression (if i can call it depression)
and use it in some kind of a creative way. Like sports, or writing texts, lyrics and stuff
but i will quickly lose motivation because i don't see purpose in it.
Another thing that crossed my mind was
""F*ck it. You will not have a normal life. But you can
focus on what you like to do and learn.
You can be good at something and that will give you strength .. and purpose""
I always wanted to learn and understand things. But I'm too cynical and realist.
So.. cards are out and i don't know what to do next. I guess i will go watch another episode
of rick and morty and then go to sleep, wishing not to wake up next morning. I wish i was in peace with myself.
What would you guys do? I'm mentally tired.. And it's getting scarier since i started to plan stuff...This text was two times longer but i shortened it so it's readable.
And I'm really sorry for mistakes. English is not my native language.",1
"Hi.. My name is Martin, I'm 18 years old and I need to vent out a little bit.. I'm tired. I feel like I've been living for 100 years already. I would describe my problem as ""existential depression"" if something like that exists. It all started, as i remember, an year ago when i realised I'm gay. But my sexuality isn't the root of my problem. I was always kinda intoverted, melancholic and dark minded cos of things that happened in our family and other things.. It just made me think a lot more then ever before. This year was, thanks to this ""lightbulb moment"", mostly about my personal development and trying to ""find myself"". I feel like completely different person now, in a good way. I've set my life goals and similar stuff.. But it wasn't so bright as it seems. I'm tired because i don't want answers anymore. I feel like I've had enough of this world. I'm writing this because I'm not in the best mood rn. But i feel like that almost every damn day. It's like ""nothing and nobody have a purpose"". To be honest, almost everyday I'm trying to find a reasons why not to kill myself.
I'm not gonna kill myself. I know it. It's just my dream. Every morning is not start of a ""new adventure"". It's start of another nightmare and I'm just living for going to bed again, dreaming about disappearing and never having to live that life again. I'm jealous about happiness of other people. They have something i don't have.. Like.. Spark or whatever.
I hate things like alcohol, cigarettes, drugs and similar. I want to keep my body clean. But sometimes i just want to buy few bottles and drink to death. Still, I'm trying to resist. I even started to do sports to distract myself. I was running two times per day to give my day a purpose instead of hurting myself or doing similar stupid stuff. It was my way to exhaust myself physically. I didn't want to cut or anything. This running routine helped but not for long.
So I'm here, stuck in this vicious circle with my nihilistic thoughts and opinions while listening to Elliott Smith and overthinking... I don't know what to do..
Visiting a therapist or someone? Cool, but i don't to take any medications or something. It's disgusting for me.I don't even know what i want.. Writing this out helped me but i still feel empty. I want to cry but i can't. It's like that almost an year already and the hardest thing is to pretend you're ok around others..
And I'm scared that it will never end.
Only thing I'm still here for are people i care about. If they would not be here, i would probably do something stupid.I've tried to keep it as short as possible and there's much more into it and i feel like words are not enough to describe it. Also, I apologize for my english, it's not my native language.",0

I don't want to get into it in this initial post, but I really want to talk to someone.I know this seems like a cry for attention, but really, its a cry for help. I'm aware enough to recognize that.Thanks.",1

"His journey started after learning everything he could from his master, but he wanted to test his skills with one of the three knights. A long journey took him across plains, he had to climb dangerous mountains, sail across perilous seas, and even fly over a river of lava, flowing from a volcano that hasn't died in years and years.
Suddenly, he spots rainfall coming from one spot, coming from infinity, but curving as it nears the land. The man treks through a jungle to find that the rainfall passes into a cave, and slides down a hole at the edge of the entrance. He throws a rock down the pit, but hears nothing but the rush of water.
""Who goes there!"", a weary voice goes.
""A man looking for a knight with extraordinary powers, they say three brothers were knighted by the King of this land as the Trinity of Trigonometry, and I thought I'd be able to find someone here...""
An old man was wearing a toga which extended from his right arm down to his left leg (with an exposed left arm and right leg) shuffled from the darkness, his now white, scraggly beard covering most of his face, his eyes filled with the intelligence of one who has seen much, but is tired of living.
""So you've come to find a knight? Well, you've found a man who was one, once. I am the middle brother, the eldest being Sindbad, and the youngest being Cosmos""
The man looked the old hermit  up and down, unsure of himself.
He asked,

I'm 27, gay white male living in Texas. I just totally fucked up my life. I just found out I am HIV positive and another std.  I started sleeping around exactly one month ago, mostly unprotected. 14 people I should contact. Most of them were not ""high risk"" contacts but this particular strain of chlamydia is resistant.

After beating homelessness for 6 months, and keeping my shit together then, I am so angry at myself for not being in control now. I wonder why all the recklessness and what triggered that.

"I actually don't know why I'm telling anyone about this. Ever since my first depression scare back in seventh grade, I've always thought I was getting better. The feelings kinda faded out, and I generally internalised any desire to kill myself. I think that's because my mother started calling it emotional blackmail after about 3 months. She tends to put me down a lot. The thing is, no matter how much we argue, no matter how little self-worth she makes me feel, I still love her, and she loves me. My death wish was just general, hoping for a truck to hit me, or a random heart attack, maybe an aneurysm. I wouldn't want to kill my self at all, I had a lot of hope, but I wouldn't have minded dying. I always lied on those depression questionnaires at the doctor's office, I had a feeling my mother would yell at me. But recently my life hasn't been going so perfectly. In certain areas, I'm fuckin golden, life is great, I'm actually on track for debate team leadership and I'm enjoying school somehow. But everywhere else just hurts. I've gotten worse at swimming after taking a month off, my grades are slipping in a few classes thanks to teachers who give about three assignments a month, and on good days I talk to people outside of my family circle. On bad day's I just get reprimanded for not being a top performer, and not being like the rest of the Indian community. I hold my fingers up to my head and pretend it's a gun a lot. Try to fantasize about what it would feel like. I do it a lot around my mom. I just pretend I'm scratching an itch, she hasn't really commented on it. Frankly, I have conversations with myself inside my head when I'm swimming, or when I'm lonely; it tends to make me feel a bit better. Other times it makes me feel worse. I don't do anything to get more friends, or even to keep them, just because I fucked up back in seventh grade making me worry that doing anything would make it worse. Yesterday, I wanted to skip swimming, and then my mom told me that some friends of mine were ditching to go for a football game. She offered to take me, but I decided to go to swimming instead, mainly because that wouldn't involve as much interacting with people. I wanted to become a comedian, but I've realised I'm not cut out for that. I also wanted to be a neurologist or neurosurgeon, but I've realised I'm not cut out for that. I've actually thought of how WWIII would give me a chance to enlist and die fighting, making me a little bit more useful. Then I realised I'm clearly insane to even imagine that. I don't know how to end this. The post or my life, it's not like I have a gun or anything. I've heard that bleach often fails, and I don't want to risk that. So basically, my only effective method is jumping off the roof of my school or some other tall-ish building. God fucking dammit, I hate myself.",1

"I am 20, I can't tell much about my personal life however, all I would say is that I have this particular issue that my family and some people mock me for. They don't understand it. It has been causing me a lot of depression for long. I am now also in a relationship but my family wouldn't approve of it.. It may get to the point that they would literally create lots of arguments for me.. My sibling also had certain issue and moved far away to Europe to get away from my family because they were causing her hell! She tried explaining them but they wouldn't listen and would just laugh at her to the point she decided to sort of.. screw them and make her own choices... Since I am young, I don't have to take any step for my relationship just yet but later on I may need to and just the thought about that stresses me. My family thinks they are doing right in their own way and are trying to protect us.. While I was away to Canada for university, I got disconnected from them to the point that I was willing to stand up for myself for what I believe in and also, I sort of started hating them for dividing the family so much. However, whenever I go back home to France, my family show me so much love that I end up feeling guilty for everything I feel, think, believe etc. For summer vacation, I stayed with my family for 3 months back home and I got so connected that I feel soo depressed. They seriously do a lot for me... Its just that they think what they are doing is right and no amount of argument or discussion is going to change their mind.. Believe me, I tried. I was pretty much a ... family oriented person back when I was in high school.. My siblings were my bestfriends as I was bullied a lot in high school. I have also been sexually assaulted. I loved hanging with my family more than anyone else. Now its so hard. My depression has increased to the point that I ended up getting bad grades, have headaches all the time, lost interest in my partner, feel tired all the time, just thinking about future makes me cry and the only way I feel a little relaxed is when I think "" Ah perhaps I will die soon"".. Also, I am having lots of problems with my university.. Professers are shit, degree is risky cos people who graduated from here, some of them claimed that many faced problems cos of their degree... as the university isn't accredited by the Canadian law.. Rather the country the university is originally from... I talked to my family about it but they don't think anything would happen and just keep telling me "" Don't listen to others "" .. I am so fed up of explaining them literally anything that I am just done. I don't wanna do it now. I am so stressed about literally everything.. Career, family, future etc. I don't know what the hell to do.. I just wanna kill myself. The only thing holding me back from committing suicide is the thought of hell existing and me not knowing whether God is pleased with me or not.",1
"I am 25 and have been taking anti-depressants for a few years now and just last week my brother who had a severe learning disability hung himself in the kitchen.

I will never escape, I will only feel worthless and unhappy or feeling nothing. My life doesn't have a happy ending. It is the result of the entropy of happiness. Every day I will still taste happiness, but a sliver compared to the day before it and an invisible speck compared to two days before. Is living really worth it? I am probably not going to die right now, but I am going to sleep soon and hopefully die and get replaced with someone worth other people's time and care.",1

"I am constantly dealing with the feeling that no matter what I attempt to do, I will always be a failure, or just a mediocre person at best. I made the mistake of taking history for a BA, and after realizing what a useless degree it truly is I decided to go for an MA in hopes it would bump up my resume at least. I am now trying to start writing my final thesis and I have completely hit a dead end, I can't come up with anything and I'm already a month into the semester. Let's face it, history BA's just don't get people jobs. It's damn near impossible.Any full-time job I have attempted to work in has been a complete disaster, the only thing I have listed on my resume are working at McDonald's for a year, and other restaurants for 2 summers. I'm 23 years old and my resume is absolutely pathetic. If I can't handle a full-time job, let alone even get one, I'm fucked. I have already taken out loans for this degree and if I can't get it, I'm doubly fucked. All of that money and work will be for nothing. Don't even get me started on my love life, which right now basically consists of a guy that has used me to vent out his own sexual frustration under the ruse that he wants to give our relationship ""another shot"" (he dumped me a few months ago before summer vacation started). But then again I figure its better than being completely alone, since I can't stand to be by myself and think about how much of a loser I am.This degree is the one chance I have left to make something out of my life. I can't stand being worthless and useless anymore. I have no other talents or hobbies that would make me any more useful or interesting. If I can't get this degree and drop out, I will absolutely end my life. It has no purpose so far anyway, so why not?",1

"I am crying as im typing this I just really can't take this feeling anymore I may as well give out why I feel this way. My father was abusive to my mother and I grew up around a dysfunctional household when I was 7 my father finally left I was ""happy"" I guess back then I thought to myself I was strong enough to deal with it but as I grew older I realised not having a father figure really hurts. I feel like my mom took care of me and my sister really well (sister is is going to NYU) but I feel like I have dissapointed her I always gave her trouble ever since elementary school I dropped out of private school from bad grades in 6th grade so I moved to a public school made a lot of friends I mainly hanged out with the nerdy type kids but even there I felt left out at times I felt like they never did like me in their group (This is where I started developing social anxiety) after maybe 4 months I stopped going to middle school completely and I somehow got into high school (I guess it just wasn't worth the hassle to keep me there) I never did go to high school maybe for 3 months and at that point I felt like I was finally overcoming my social anxiety and depression but then as I was walking back home from school I got mugged by a couple of big kids (they were seniors I was a freshman) at that point I just couldn't take it anymore I thought to myself after all this time of feeling like complete garbage and finally overcoming it the world throws me a big ""fuck you"" so I stopped going to school for maybe 2 years after giving my mom so much trouble I guess she thought I needed more ""extreme measures"" (I knew she was doing it because she cared about me but I fought over the idea) so I was sent to a therapeutic foster home the first home I went to I went to school everyday (even got myself on the honor roll somehow) but then I got into a fight with another foster kid living there so I was moved to a second home and over there I feel i've felt my worst the parents there did not like me at all they would talk behind my back and even in front of me of how ""bad"" of a kid I am and I just couldn't take it anymore there were countless times where I told the people that overlooks the foster home of how shit I feel there but I couldn't leave... So I did the only thing I could do and that was running away I ran smoked some marijuana I bummed off of a homeless man and slept in a bathroom (that's how badly I wanted to stay away from the foster home) the next day I got a call and got locked in a psychiatric ward where I met people I guess I would consider ""friends"" and I was happier but being locked in a psychiatric ward for a few months just made me want to be outside I even met a girl in there that I got along with and liked (we had alot of the same problems) got into a sort of relationship I guess with her (I know bad idea) but my second to last day there she just told me she liked someone else in there I was pretty hurt and I didn't even thing about it and just started cutting my wrists the next day I was  discharged but I hid the scars so I could get out and now (2017) I've been feeling a lot better about myself just got a job and less anxiety when talking to people but for some reason I still feel SO lonely, coming home I guess is the hardest part...No friends or family to talk to, No one to hear my stupid jokes, no one to even hear how lonely I am...",0

"I am feeling suicidal today, for the first time in about 5 months. I will do my best to sum things up here, however it's still going to be long either way I'm afraid - had depression/anxiety/low self esteem/ptsd for a number of years. Been having DBT therapy weekly for nearly two years now. Has been incredibly helpful, more so than any other therapy I've tried, medications etc. A couple of months back a had a 'turning point' with the therapy and could really feel the impact it had had. I felt truly positive for the first time in years. Truly happy. Like I was able to conquer anything. And it wasn't fake this time (and I know what that feels like, this wasn't it). This was different. I was doing incredibly well. However - a couple of months ago after speaking with my therapist about it for a while, I decided to get back in contact with my absent father (since parents divorce when I was 15, now 27) via a long letter. I got short response letter back a week later. The response was fairly positive. However, the phone call we had two days later, was not and he was belittling, insulting about my epilepsy, brought up the past, was derogatory towards my mum, lied about a few things etc. Ended very badly and I ended contact with him for good. Since then I have taken about 10 steps back therapy-wise and it has been affecting every area of my life, but particularly my relationship with my boyfriend which started just before i got in contact with my dad again. Everything was great with my boyfriend before, because I actually felt good enough, I felt positive all the time and because I felt good enough I had nothing to worry about. But now..I have the same question that has come back that has haunted me for years, and even though there is a rational part of me that knows it is my dad with the problem and not me..I still end up chalking it down to me not being good enough for him, or anyone. That question is ""if my dad doesn't love me, who will?"". Or similar questions. ""If my dad won't stick by me, what man will?"". I only seem to see the negative and not the positive like my mum sticking by me, because my negative thoughts and worries are so powerful that I truly believe my mum and anyone else in my life including my boyfriend would be better off without me. I don't even think they want me in their lives. I can't tell my boyfriend any of this because I've only been with him for about 9 weeks and although he knows the dad stuff and some things from my past and he was understanding and helpful, if I tell him I'm suicidal right now that's a one way ticket to losing a boyfriend. I don't want to tell any of my 'friends', I already feel like they don't want to talk to me most of the time and when I do talk to them I feel like because we hardly speak because we live far apart etc I don't want to be that Debbie Downer every time I speak to them. I'm just pushing everyone away, when I speak to them and when I don't speak to them. I feel paranoid and suspicious about my boyfriend a lot. I never feel good enough but then I feel no man is good enough for me, my standards are so incredibly high because of my past with abusive relationships. I can't even explain everything in this post and now I'm just rambling. I don't know what to do. I can't stop crying. I just hate myself and I hate my brain, I'm in a constant battle with it when I get in states like this, even when I don't feel suicidal. I struggle so much with pushing negative thoughts out of my mind. They are so much easier to believe than positive ones. Will I ever feel good enough? Why is there no painless way to end everything? I can't get a break from my overthinking. I can't even speak to my therapist about it most of the time because she's not an on call therapist and I only see her weekly for 50 mins, and in the moods I've been in the past month or so, most of the time I've felt like I could talk to someone for hours :( ",1
"I am finally living with the man I love. We got along great until a few weeks ago. Long story short, he has a woman ""best friend"" who he chats with frequently. He knows my feelings towards that friendship, as she was the reason he moved away a couple years ago.
He won't tell me anything about their friendship, just that she's a really good friend. They had a fight around the time he moved in with me, and he didn't speak with her for 7 months. Now they're speaking again, and he never tells me what they chat about. He won't even tell me what the fight was about, other than it was a misunderstanding.
We are going on a trip next week, and I have paid for about 90% of it, because I love him, and want him to experience some fun. He has depression and anxiety as well. He is not himself since he started on a new med, he doesn't even cuddle me anymore.
Today, we were grocery shopping, and whenever he texts this woman, he never says anything. He had a huge smile on his face, which I haven't seen in a long time. I asked if it was because he was excited about the trip, and he said he hasn't really been thinking about it.

"I am going to throw this out there, I am 12. So I really hope what I'm feeling is just stupid teenage hormones but here we go (the story is going to be jambled sorry)
Almost everyday all I feel is anger, frustration, hopelessness, anxiety, and sadness. I wake up everyday either anxious, mad, or depressed. I never get much sleep for a night and the next day I sleep for a whole day. Sometimes I get a slightly normal sleep schedule but I don't feel much better.
Mainly around when school happens my mood reaches the worst. Everyday I'm told to kill myself, I feel like I'm smart for some seconds to only realize that I was completely wrong, and bullied more and more about my appearance (I'm really ugly and fat). I have Show Choir which further decreases my self-esteem because we have to look at ourselves and all I see is an ugly angry 12 year old who shouldn't exist and I get worse and worse because I get tired so quickly and I feel depressed.
I ask my parents if I can go to online school, but they think it won't work and yell at me just for mentioning it.
Remembering, I had this depressive behavior since 2nd grade where I would draw myself as a dead body. (I was bullied since kindergarten)
If I ever get angry or upset my mom makes fun of me for it mocking me at how I complain.
I even have stupid childish behaviors like I still suck my finger, I didn't potty train myself til I was 11, and I still carry around a blanket.
I hate everyday how I get compared to my sister. Everyday someone compares me with my sister.
I feel worse about school also as I have murder impulses. I never hurt anyone but I many times wanted to. I remember last week in Science a girl was picking on me and I almost went up to her and wanted to strangle her and kill her slowly. I became so guilty because of that I became scared that one day I will hurt someone.
Every time I try to rant somewhere, it gets labeled as ""just some over-reactive 12 year old"" so I always bottle everything up. If I yell at my parents I'm instantly grounded.
I can have times where I'm extremely motivated then I quickly stop being motivated.
I have a such a bad habit I think I might have a superiority complex. If I'm talking to someone, I have to find something that makes me feel better and more valued, but nothing ever makes me feel better.
I tried to kill myself multiple times with a knife but my own cowardliness made me not do it. Closest I've been was ween I was 9 and almost slit my throat.
I also see things and hear this horrible ringing or pounding in my ears many times. I see things in the corner in my eye, in my bed I think I'm being stalked sometimes (even tho i highly am not) and I see random things slightly. Like right now on the white background I see a face of a demon opening its mouth.
I can't go to my bedroom without an external noise and all the lights on. I had so many horrible nightmares and fears and all these bad things I can't go up there.
I feel things crawling on me 24/7 and I always feel itchy somewhere.
I hate being touched. I wasn't sexually touched or anything its just I get so scared of being touched as lots of times in school people hit me.
I get very bad nightmares to the point where I don't want to sleep because of it.
I get violent shivers some times.
I can't cross roads at all (when I was younger I was almost hit by a car) and I get intense anxiety crossing them
TL;DR: I feel extremely sad and depressed and some other random things

I am in college and struggling with half the workload that others who are in the program full time. I can't properly communicate with people due to my anxiety, with my conversations end up consisting of stuttering and scrambled sentences. I want to kill myself by the end of this year if I can't finish school, it feels like its the only thing that keeps me going despite making me depressed to the point where I can't think straight. I am on my last semester and have already tried to take a semester off to get things sorted out with my heath but in that time I ended up being unemployed and losing all my old friends from high school due to my mental health problems. After I stopped talking to them I've been trying to expand my social circle, and been trying to go out and be active in the community volunteering. I almost got into a relationship with someone but she eventually figured out about my mental health issues after she began too open up about hers and now she doesn't even talk too me. Last time I heard about her she moved on and is in a relationship like a week after she stopped talking to me. I have been seeking counseling but it hasn't been as helpful as it was when I started 6 months ago. It feels like nothing positive has happened to me this year, I'm back where I am started with school, still struggling with a part time course load, and have lost contact with all the people I used to call my friends from high school. I have no way to properly communicate and relate to the people in my classes and in the outside world and therapy hasn't been helping for awhile now. Why should I continue to try and achieve my goals when people like me are not meant to achieve them. I feel like a loser, I am making plans to kill myself in the new year if things don't go well with school, but I might do it sooner if I continue to feel the way I am now. I am going hang myself in the woods away from everyone I know so I can die alone.",1

"I am losing the will to live. I am a widow at 23. Just had to spend my 1 yr anniversary alone. I married the perfect man and I ruined my whole life in one day. In one week I lost my husband, career, physical health, mental health, many friends, and all self confidence. All of this started with a car wreck. I haven't been working for months, my job is sore at me. My friends who were there for me have abandoned me due to my own isolation or lack of motivation to help me. My career means nothing to me and I don't even want to be in the same field. I have a masters and I don't want it anymore. I used to be happy and now I can barely be bothered to get up and take a shower in a day or maintain a healthy diet. I hate myself. I just want to die. I feel like I should have died from the wreck too. My life is a never ending shit fest where I get guilt tripped into living. Fuck these people who get to be bystanders at the glorious trainwreck that is my life. Oh, icing on the cake, I am facing felony manslaughter charges for my husbands death as well. I hate my life. I just want to hurt myself but I am an unmotivated coward. The only thing that keeps me going is the distractions I find like online shopping and cleaning and getting rid of anything that reminds me of my previously happy life that was actually going places.

I am planning my death,1
I am so afraid of women that I should take my own life,1
I am so alone in this world. Everyone ignores me and I feel like I am invisible.I have no friends. I'm super stressed out and bored from life giving me the same things everyday. I feel trapped and nothing and no one is willing to help me out of this box. The only logical way of getting out is to commit suicide. I think ending would be more fun than seeing another day on this miserable world. I need help.,1
I am such an idiot. I am such a colossal idiot. I had a perfect job. Was about to get hrt and see my fiance'. And I blew it. I fucking blew it. I took a purse out of a trashcan now the company wants me to pay it back and fired me in the process. Ontop of my already massive student debt. I was also thoroughly humiliated through the process.This is it. Either tonight or tomorrow I'm taking a gun to my head and pulling the trigger. I will never live this down. I can't pay it back. And it'll probably be on my record forever. So I guess this really is the end. I fucking knew things were going to well. I knew things were going to well for me not to fuck it up in some colossal fantastic way.Goodbye. I'm done. This is just where it stops. This stupid story has gone on far enough. I'm getting rest.,0

I am writing my suicide note while sitting next to my 4 year old beautiful daughter watching Sesame Street.My diseased brain is winning.,1
"I am/was (decide for yourself I guess) a sadistic psychopath. I felt no emotion for anyone, it was all emulated. I was a flawless liar and no one ever suspected I was anyone other than who I presented as. I hated most people and it made me happy to see them suffer. I've never physically harmed anyone, but I have ruined people's lives for no reason other than malice. I'm also a longtime user of this sub and frequently preyed upon those seeking help on here via PM. I suspect some of them killed themselves because of me. It wasn't my specific intention but it gave me an unrivaled feeling of satisfaction.I was also a very reckless and self-destructive person without fear. I would do anything just for the experience without worrying about the consequences. The law of averages caught up to me and I made the mistake that I think is going to end me. I decided to transition into a woman for (at the time) fetishistic reasons using hormones. I lied my way through potential gatekeeping, told them I had dysphoria my whole life and all that, it was easy. A few weeks after starting hormones things got weird and only got weirder the longer it went on. Firstly, I was always planning to kill myself while quite young because I felt like my existence was wrong, it was a very vague feeling but it was intense and I had no fear of death so I just decided I would kill myself whenever life stopped being fun. Very quickly that feeling went away. The next change was I started developing emotionally, a full range of emotions I had never experienced. I always thought I was very good at managing my emotions but I think I just never had any emotions to manage. This was/is quite overwhelming. The change that seems like it's going to be my downfall is my developing emotional empathy. I started to care about people and their struggles, even random strangers. It felt so good I would go to bad neighborhoods and give money to homeless people, sit with them and listen to them talk about their lives. It made me happy to make them happy, and thinking about their pain hurt me. I feel like I'm finally turning into a complete person, I didn't understand how empty I was because I never had anything to compare it to.Along with this emotional empathy, though, was something else that I think won't stop escalating until I either kill myself or have a psychotic break. I started to feel guilty about the kind of person I was before and what I did, and it keeps getting worse and it's already unbearable. On top of this I've started getting flashbacks of childhood trauma, and my sanity is slipping rapidly. I want to kill myself again for these new reasons but hilariously there are people in my life I now care about who would be crushed if I did. If anything can be described as poetic justice it's this I imagine. I could de-transition but I never want to go back to how I was, physically or mentally. I don't expect sympathy or even belief from anyone, but I wanted to type this out anyway. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I never want to hurt anyone ever again, I wish I had never hurt anyone, I wish I could take it all back but I can't and nothing I can do will ever make up for it and I'm sorry. This guilt is destroying me and I can't express how sorry I am. ",1

"I basically just feel like i'm prisoner, I can't imagine a futur for myself, my days are the same and i'm feeling forced to do what im doing.After being bullied a lot durng school, I stopped it and stood at home for multiple years, playing online video games and making friends on it, it helped me escaping real life and the thoughts of killing myself.
Years later, 21, i havent done anything with my life, lot of shit happened making it even worse, i didnt really go outside through these years, i have no friends around my city, all are eirher from different countries or at the opposite side of it.I recently got a small job on internet that gives me 700$/month, it helps me making my mind busy so i dont think a lot, but i dont di anything beside this, listening to music (linkin park hello), i even almost dont play video games anymore when i used to do it  lot every day for years.I feel like my futur is pointless, i dont feel the courage to do anything like going outside, the main reason being that i have nobody to hang out with, i cant find any positive point in my life, i dont feel like i can enjoy anything, even when il trying to, i fail. I feel like i cant get a normal life again, feel like i'm ugly and mainly worthless.I never achieved anything good in my life and never made anyone proud, each day feel like being in jail, i just feel forced to keep on breathing, i recently was in a long distance relationship, during these 2 months my depressive thoughts were gone, i felt happy, the reason i got my actual job is bcs i wanted money to visit the girl, but it didnt happen because she ended it before, which gave me the depression back with an even bigger pain.If i dont keep myself busy i just overthink, think avout death and try to tbink about a way to kms without pain.Id like to be happy but i feel like whatever i do isnt enough, and when i manage to feel happy, something quickly happens to break it all I just feel like i dont have any strenght left to get up, go outside on a regular basis or finding anything that makes me happy, im just totaly dead inside and fake to be happy",1

I can't walk more than ten metres and I have to pretend to the world I don't have it. I've tried to seek out medical help. No one available. I know exactly what meds I need and I can't get them.I don't feel like I should bother with anything anymore. I just want to curl up in a corner and die. I hope this leg infection kills me, but I highly doubt it. I just don't want to deal with anything. I don't want to talk to people.

"I came here because I feel like this is the only place that I can  talk to someone about this.

She told me that she still loved me and still wanted to spend time with me when she could but didn't want a relationship until she felt her life was more stable but a month after we broke up she started dating this other guy and cut me off. This was around june-july when this happened and I'm still upset, I still think about it every day and I just don't feel like I should be this upset. A normal person wouldn't be this hurt over  a girl they only knew for a month or 2. And the fact that I am just makes me feel like I'm not meant to be here, like im not meant to find love and have a family  because I don't know how to just let go. I used to have goals and things that I looked forward to but every day that passes I feel worse and worse and I just want it to end already.",0

"I came to this belief last week. I was at my therapist and I said it out loud. I told him that I likely would not do it soon, but that my long term mental health suggested that would be the way I'd go.That seems like a shitty thing to do to someone who is trying to help.We agreed to break our arrangement. He said he would follow up with references to a psychiatrist and a life coach. Having had plenty of experience with illegal drugs, and limited experience with prescription drugs, I doubted that a scrip would help. All the same, he could forward me the references.He hasn't, yet. I am not exactly enamored with his professionalism... but people can improve. He is the last of 5 therapists that I've seen through my 20s.I admitted to him in a prior session that I was a cocaine and sex addict. Until a month ago, I partied a lot. I wouldn't even call it partying. I would get home by 3 am, and stay gakked up till 8. I would sometimes call over an escort. The funny thing is that I wouldn't even have sex with them. Partially because coke leaves you unable to perform. But I just needed to hold someone, and feel another human body next to mine. I read that close human contact can stimulate the release of feel-good chemistry for the brain. I've always been about that feel-good chemistry.I have used drugs on and off for almost a decade. I'm sure that this time of substance abuse has contributed to the mess of neural tissue in my head.I (think I) have these episodes of self destructiveness to counterbalance what I think of as the rigid discipline of my daily life. Wake up at 5. Get to the gym by 545. Exercise and shower. Start work 815. Lunch 1130-1230. Continue till 8pm. Home by 830. Jerk off, read, etc, 930. Sleep. Repeat. The Appollo to my Dionysius.I hate my work. I am the youngest and least experienced person here. I am asked to lead projects and know more than the salts I work with. I am held accountable for collective failures while everyone I work with can claim it is not part of their narrow responsibilities. I am a highly paid professional scapegoat who charmed his way into a job that he is grossly underqualified for, and is now paying the price for a lack of work ethic. I make money that goes into a savings account. I can eat, and drive, and live without discomfort. I really don't need more.I left my last job because I felt I lacked purpose. I moved across the country. I realize now that I was trying to run from myself. Now an opportunity to go somewhere else has appeared... Good luck with that.I am close to family, here in my new city. My parents, my brother. Niece and nephew. I haven't lived with them in a decade. These people love me but they don't know the person that I am. I can't talk to them about this, because I have before, and it made things worse.When the coroner calls my parents, will my dad have that heart attack? Will my mom have a stroke? Will I destroy my family? I know the answer to these questions. It's unbearable that the only thing to free me from this world will wreak such havoc.I am unlovable. I can't be in a relationship with someone. I am mercurial. I am physically insecure. I am prone to letting my Dionysian take control and lose control. That's why the last three left. I am past the point in life where I can madly fall in love with someone. And yet, some tiny, simian impulse keeps telling me that finding someone to lie down with, to hold, to laugh with, finding someone who understands me and cares for me, someone who will be kind to me, will fix me. Hey, ladies - one 100% basket case, all for the taking. Please, get in line.There are many ways to do it. Suicide by cop, step in front of a train, call my dealer and ask him for fentanyl. But I don't want to implicate someone in my death. I don't want a stranger to bear the burden of my death. There are 5 storey parking garages all around me. That will probably be how it happens.I'm not going to kill myself tonight. I am frankly too fatigued to make an attempt. But I'm closer than I have ever been in my life. I'm not at the end of the road, but I can see it from here.My life is dull, lacking in spark. I see no reason to keep going. I don't know what to do, or what will help. I want an answer to fall out of the sky. I hope that it does for all of you.",1

I don't know how much more I can tolerate. Between the things I can't help but remember and the things that are currently happening to me and the people around me that I'm helpless to stop, I want to escape.

I've really tried talking to people,  but I'm aware of how much bullshit is passed on just to make people ""realize they don't actually wanna die"" which is true for some people but is it possible to be in a situation where death is the only option? I just really really hate the idea of being alive and I'm not even kidding the only thing keeping me alive is not being able to do the actual deed. Not because I don't want to but because I'm scared of it. I feel like I have plenty of reasons to be depressed yet none of them are what makes me want to be dead.

"I can't get these suicidal thoughts out of my head, I have been sleeping all day just to cancel it out, I don't want to hurt my family. If my family weren't in the way I would have ended myself years ago. I have college and stuff on my chest too but it's so hard to focus. Am I not fit for society? I am in physical pain from being so fucking depressed",1

I can't help but feel worthless.,1
"I can't keep myself going.  I lost my mom to cancer, so the only reason I feel like sticking around is because my death would destroy my father.  That and my dear old dog.  I'm afraid that once he's gone I'm gonna go past my breaking point.  I'm in so much pain, i feel like if there was an easy way to end it all i'd have taken it already. Let's start at the beginning.  I've been obese since the day I was born. As long as i can remember my stoner mother and neglegent father fattened me up.   I was a momma's boy, and since my mom was a 300 lb stoner, my young impressionable habits followed suit.  I was averse to healthy eating, averse to sports, and averse to social interaction. It wasn't even that i didn't want to be social.  I tried my best, but i was constantly mentally and harassed for my weight.  Groped, punched, had shit thrown at me, and abused in so many more ways i can''t describe, but my teachers and principal never cared about me until i lashed back, since i was so much bigger than these kids. This extended all throughout middle school and high school.   People hated me merely for .The memories echo through my head, day in, day out, every moment of my life.  When my mind is idle it will drift to all the abusive shit people have done to me. I have a constant desire to find these old classmates online and tell them that i hope they are hit by a car.  I got my dad stuck in a toxic relationship after i formed a close bond with my dad's slightly insane girlfriend who i latched onto after my mother died of cancer when i was 9. He's almost 60 now and I feel like he'll never find love again because of me.  He stayed in that relationship because of me, and since I am just like him, he can't get over the wrong that's been done to him.  This among my many other screw ups growing up, such as getting sucked into check fraud and getting kicked out of middle school for assaulting someone (long story, but i was in the wrong.) have made me feel like i've made his life miserable.  I have an older brother, but he's gay as well.  It kills me that i can't at least make him a grandparent.For a while there i was okay.  I had some good friends and a lot more confidence in myself because of it, but as we started drifting apart i picked up some self destructive behaviors and friends to follow. I started smoking weed religiously and still do to this day, my head hurts without it.  I took so much LSD my senior year my head has never quite felt the same.  I got into video games and daydreaming as an escape.  I'm always imagining my own world of wonder, the idea that I might write it into a book one day keeps me entertained with living any longer.  If i die, the stories die too.  I've had a couple ""best friends"" who turned out to be extremely toxic to me.  Most recently, i snapped at someone i once considered the best friend i'd ever have because he was so fucking stupid, pretentious and ignorant.  Things got worse when i discovered my sexuality.  I was sleeping around pretty young and contracted gonnohrea at 17, one week before Senior prom.  I had no clue what was going on and was deathly afraid of telling my dad, so i let it fester unknowingly for about a week.  I did finally get myself treated and seemed to be fine again.  Until my symptoms resurfaced several months later. I've done irreprable damage to my urethra, it takes me longer than normal to urinate. Ejaculating and urinating can be uncomfortable and even a little painful at times because the last bit of fluid never seems to fully evacuate, and i can feel it.  I've been to a urologist several times and they don't seem to know what to do with me.  My problem stems from stress and excessive sex and masturbation, the more i stress the harder it becomes for me.  This has become a HUGE problem for me.  I don't want to live like this, when every time I get stressed out it becomes difficult to pee or potentially worse as my prostate clamps down.  And I'm constantly stressed, the condition feeds off itself.  I'm stressed about how it will affect me as i get older, only making the condition worse. This all came to a head about 3 weeks ago.  My sweet dog, the only thing that makes me feel whole and happy and gets me through the day, got pepper sprayed by the mailman because i left the door open a moment too long.  This caused something in me to snap.  I want this man to suffer in so many unfathomable ways.  I'm so angry, he pepper sprayed my baby, my child, a 12 pound dog.  My dog is fine, but this happened the very day after i got back from a very stressful trip out of town in which i missed my him so much.Prior to this occurence, i was somewhat normal, though everything i mentioned about myself still apparent, and still suicidal.  After though, something snapped.  I can't stop thinking of all the ways I've been hurt.  I'm constantly angry and just don't feel like continuing.  I have trouble getting out of bed.My behavior is really starting to scare me. I've become a recluse, i don't want to leave my house, and this just makes everything worse.  I always catch saying weird shit out loud when I'm home alone and mumbling to myself in public, typically having something to do with a random thought i had.  I have constant thoughts of revenge and suicide.  Neither of which I truly want to act upon, but they're there, burning themselves into my mind. I am going to school but my grades are awful, so i'm basically mooching off my dad.  This isn't working for me, I'm 19 and need to find a job already, but i'm so adverse to social interaction and my condition keeps me afraid of a work space due to my bathroom problems.I don't want to kill myself, i just want to cease existing.  I didn't ask for this life, i didn't want any of this, but i was presented with it and constantly fuck things up making them worse.  Pushing away decent friends, getting myself into trouble.  I'm scaring myself.  I had no other clue what to do but post here.  I was prompted to seek help because I just couldn't stop crying and screaming right now, the echoes of all the abuse wouldn't stop.  I just want it to stop, i don't want to think about this shit every time my mind wanders.  I'm pretty sure everyone around me thinks I'm insane, and I'm pretty sure I'm going insane.  I'm afraid of myself.  I need to find help before i hurt myself or someone else, though typing this out has been somewhat therapuetic. Any and all thoughts and feedback are appreciated, i've always wanted to get myself evaluated but i know my father  wouldn't be willing to pay for a professional. He doesn't believe anything is wrong with me and i'm not what or how to tell him about how i really feel.",0

"I can't reach out to anyone so I'm trying anonymity. This will be a long post. Writing this out might bring me solace of some kind. Twenty one years ago I was born to an alcoholic, pothead punk of a father and the mother who was suckered into the ""bad boy"" routine because her father was mayor and mother a teacher. My mother was nineteen, a freshman in college, my father, doing nothing with his life at the time. Before long my mother decided it would be best to drop out of school. Father was a mess, spent all his money on various drugs and alcohol. My very first memory I have, as far back as I can remember, is the hole in my entryway. My room was on the opposite side of our C shaped house, at the bottom right apex of the ""C."" Straight across the long hallway that lead past a bathroom, the den, the living room, kitchen, dining room, kitchen, and finally my parents room. There was two exits. One about 20 feet from my bedroom door, one about fifteen from my parents door. I remember my father coming home, and hearing my mother quietly whispering to him. I cracked my door open and stared down the long hallway to watch my father towering over my mother, probably drunk, high, maybe both. He was holding his head and she raised her tone slightly before smashing a hole about the size of my head into the entryway wall. She was quiet and went into her room. He followed shortly after. I never saw my father hit my mother, but I would see occasional bruises. She covered them well. I don't know how she felt, she tried to be positive to me. I was a very confused child. We lived in the middle of nowhere, deep in the woods, no religion, no church. It was just the three of us and the woods. My mother got a job from her father. It paid well and was enough to barely support us. My mother racked up a large amount of debt keeping the house afloat until my father was able to get his act together. I spent my time outside most of the time during the summers. Doing my best to avoid my father. He was very uncaring, but terrifying when angry. At this point, I'm five years old. My dad wouldn't quite hit me, he'd chase me down the hall to my room until I fell over and cried. My mother would scold him, but he held himself together due to my age. The nights were filled with my night terrors. I had very vivid dreams my whole life. Still do.I had a baby brother by the time I was six, and a sister shortly after. I didn't realize how different things were until I lost the title of ""only child."" Fast forward to fourteen. We were moving from my small C shaped home in the woods to the town me and my siblings went to school in. My father hit me regularly by this point, but I'd rather not dwell on it. By this point my father was very cold and unreceptive to my attention. I was to blame. I messed up their twenties. I didn't really believe those words, just kind of thought them in the back of my head. Most of my childhood I spent avoiding my parents, exploring the woods since my parents lost all interest in me by the time I was able to be independent and I had siblings. After we moved, the money tensions rose drastically. My mother lost her empathy and had a very short temper. She wouldn't hit me, just scream. About three months after we moved in, I got in an argument with my father while I was doing the dishes and he choked me and stuck my head into the water. My mother screamed at him and I tried my best to retain my composure. My dad took off in the car, a regular occurrence by age 14. My mother was crying by the door and when I came by to apologize she screamed at me, unloading 14 years of stress onto my shoulders. How she racked up so much debt and couldn't be independent. How I ruined her marriage, her dreams, her chances, her life by being born. I left the house.I came back about a week later. I spent some time with my best (and only) friend. We'll call him Brad. Brad was tall and skinny, blonde hair and green eyes. Charismatic, quick witted, and egotistical. He was a leader, and I was his follower. We met in band class in the 8th grade and were best friends from day one. We raised hell together. He was popular and knew how to word everything perfectly to make the best of the situation. Our freshman year he dated the head cheerleader and sat with the rest of the seniors. He was that guy. I lived in his shadow. He always came back for me, though. We were like blood.After regaining my confidence he planted the seeds of independence in my mind. For the next four years of my life, I spent my life locked away and isolated from my family. They watched movies without me, ate dinner without me, and went out without me. Lived without me. It was almost a nuisance seeing me walk through the door after getting out of school. They'd scream at everything and anything. I just gave up and hid in my room as soon as I got home so they couldn't yell. I started my first job at 15, and worked as much as possible. I like to think I'm intelligent, but never felt school was the place to make my mark. I stayed quiet, living in Brad's shadow and trying to accumulate real world experience. I spent so much time living in my own head I never really looked outward to others. When I finally did, everything was an analytical act. Attempting to emulate Brad. The first case was with a girl I met in 8th Grade. Her name will be Faith. Faith had a lot of... Well.. Faith. Her family was poor and close knit, incredibly religious. She took a liking to me. She had bobbed dark hair, dark eyes, a tight cut hourglass waist, wide hips, and tits the size of my head. My adolescent self was completely intrigued. We talked on the phone daily. This continued throughout the school year until the summer came. I was excited to finally be able to spend time with my girlfriend and spend some of the money I had saved from working on someone. She told me she had to spend the summer up north with some family. We still talked daily, and it was good for me. Talking. Broke me out of my shell. She finally came back at the end of the summer, during our small town's fair. I waited all night for her.
She was there, with someone else. I gave up on women for a short time and tried to focus on work. That winter, at a parade, I ran into another young girl who I had never seen before. Short, with long black hair. Skinny, but curvy, with beautiful eyes and an amazing smile. We ran into each other crossing the road and just clicked. I repeated the process, calling her daily and staring to feel something for myself again. Summer came, and I was ready to finally spend my free time with her. She moved to North Dakota.
I waited a year, still calling her every day. Her parents eventually divorced and she moved back with her mother, at the time of the fair. I spent half the night waiting for her, and she showed up with her friend, who left shortly after. I felt alive every moment I spent alone with her. I was so happy. I finally felt normal. We wandered around the town after the fair and started a fire in some random persons fire pit. We pulled up lawn chairs and stared at the stars. I held her hand. I felt so alive. We kissed, and she told me that she slept with her abusive ex the day before I saw her, and the guilt was too much, through her tears. I stood up and walked home without saying anything. I didn't want to let myself get any more attached. That woman threw me for a loop of self harm and loathing myself for about a year. Things were still terrible at home, but I tried to keep any interactions to a minimum between school and work. I left whenever I felt like it. They didn't care where I was or what I did. I was like a ghost. The fall after that fair, during the beginning of the year, I met someone. Not necessarily someone.. More ""the one."" Brad had a friend he used to live by, who we'll call Alex. Alex's  parents owned a popular restaurant in town. He picked me and Brad up in this new car his parents bought him, and he brought some girl he liked with a bunch of her friends to this dance. No one was really going with anyone, but it was obvious who was into who. Everyone slid off into dances after we got there, except me, Brad's friend, and her. The one. ""J."" Alex asked her to dance, she refused. He stomped off into the crowd, and we sat at the table and talked. I managed to get her number and a (short and uneventful) dance. Fast forward to the deep fall. I called J up spontaneously after about a month of silence and asked if she wanted to go for a walk around town. Ironically, J lived a block behind me and one house over. We wandered through town, watching the leaves fall, telling each other the deepest thoughts we had. She asked if I wanted to watch this illusionist event that was going on that night, to which I eagerly accepted. The event was interesting until the magician started using magic as a metaphor for Christianity, to which I lost a large portion of my interest. She mumbled something about how lame it turned out, which was eye opening in such a religious conservative area that we were born. We became super close. We dated for about a year before a mutual break. That year, I focused on my work, senior year. I had an internship and two jobs outside of school and was attending a skill center for business management. Brad called me on my way home from work and told me that Alex and J were dating. I hung up without a word. I spent some time thinking, and thought maybe it was for the best. She was perfect, but that's not something to concern myself with. I just tried to stay friends. Support my best ""girl friend."" Alex had anger issues. He reminded me of my father. The ""bad boy"" who was spoiled, with lots of money. They ended up breaking up after he tried to pressure her into sex. He followed her everywhere, even smashed in a locker at school when she ghosted him. I tried to support her, and got her back on her feet. Not long after, she started dating an older guy from the town over. I was constantly invited to parties by J, hosted by her boyfriend. Brad had faded into the popular crowd and lost connection with me. So, in hopes of having a social life, I followed. At this point in my life my parents rarely spoke, in passing. I got a call from my mother while I was at my internship. My grandmother had died of cancer. She was sick for three years, and married to the inspiration of my life (grandfather), and the most kind woman I've ever met. The nightmares still haven't stopped to this day. She was the light in the darkness of my family tree. Compassionate, caring, always listening. What I imagine ""family"" is supposed to feel like. My grandfather started seeing another woman about a year after. I can't look at him the same.After she started college, J and Alex broke up. Distance, she said. He didn't look at her the same. I fell back in love with her and confessed everything to her. She came back every weekend to see me. Things were good. I graduated at 17 and was accepted to a nearby university to hers, for mechanical engineering. I was convinced to become independent and finally sever the dead ties with my family. Be my own person, build my own life. On my 18th birthday, we both lost our virginity. J was that girl that comes by once in a lifetime. She spoke softly and compassionately. She was so supportive and kind. She was perfect in every way. The perfect girlfriend. We ended up growing slightly apart due to my engrossing in school. She cheated on me. Or, that's how it felt. We were taking ""a break"" and she started seeing someone else. I quit school and took a production welding job at a factory my aunt was a human resources manager at, bought a 2010 Ford focus, bought and furnished an apartment in our hometown, and rekindled the fire between us. That was the biggest mistake of my life. She lived with me on the weekends, went to school during the week. I worked 80 hours a week, made great money, but had no time. I worked with some less than classy people. I got into Vicodin and started drinking as much as I could get. Smoking constantly. I went downhill fast. My temper shortened, and spent time at home during the weekends sleeping as soon as I got there. My body was exhausted. She still tried to be kind. I think I felt like I had it all, that she was there for good, so I vented onto her once. Unloaded. Things got worse. The Vicodin warped to pill popping. Things worsened. I came into work when it was dark, and left when it was dark. After constant fighting about 8 months into the new job, I drive my car head on into a semi at 70. I didn't even break anything. I blew it off and blamed it on a semi swerving into my lane. I bought a pistol from a sketchy friend for $325. I went into the woods where my old home was and planned on killing myself in a drunken, angry, confused stupor. J called. Told me how great her day at college was. How she helped these kids (early education major). Her voice was filled with love. I put the gun away. I know I was fucked up because when she came home and found the gun she kept asking if I would hurt myself, or her. I always denied it sharply. She didn't know about my car. Eventually I got in an argument with my supervisor and quit that day. J stayed with me until the power went out in my apartment. I kept making excuses. Lying. So many lies. She left and we fought, and then I was alone. I tried to do it so many times, tried to end it. We had done everything together, and I selfishly built my life around her. I was hopeless.
After about five months of turmoil I got a job as a maintenance person/toolmaker at a nearby factory. I got my shit together, quit all the pills and drinking, and really tried to do things right. I coaxed her back again. Things were perfect. I made her family dinner. That's when she told me they would never trust me after the last four years. I was taken aback. It got to the point where it was me or them. She chose them. She called me crying in June and told me it was over. I haven't seen her since. She deleted and blocked me on all social media. I never see her anymore. The only thing I had was a casual dress she left here. I left it on her parents doorstep about a month ago.I kept thinking I'd be fine, and even dated another girl a few months later. I took her out to dinner and we got drunk in Canada. It's a long story. Good time. She moved across state. I left her. It was for the best. My life slowly fell back apart. I started to realize how alone I was when Brad moved to South Carolina. After we graduated I spent every waking moment of free time I could with that bastard, and now he was leaving. It's been a few months. My apartment is trashed. I don't necessarily feel like I need J or Brad to feel whole, but I've been steadily feeling more and more empty. I was just told last week that I have a month to find a new job. My car died. I'm $5,000 or so in debt from the five months I wasn't working after quitting production welding. I have $158.47USD to my name. I'm feeling alone and helpless, so empty. I haven't spoken with anyone outside of work in months. The one person I went through everything with is gone, and my best friend is gone. The one family member I had is dead. My nights are filled with night terrors. I've lost 40lbs. I can't reach out anymore, I'm going crazy inside my head, Brad won't even respond to my texts. He's moved on. I wish I could. This is my cry for help.please help me",1

"I checked up on my ex's twitter after about ten years apart. Not the first time I've done this, but the most worrisome. She didn't mention suicide but I've never seen her like this. She has a lifelong history of severe PTSD from childhood abuse. She was maybe 26 when we broke up and I never noticed anything too concerning except some panic attacks and a psychotic screaming episode involving flaying a large knife through the air in my vague direction. She had taken Wellbutrin for depression but she never seemed paranoid aside from a few episodes and I only recently started noticing some of her tweets getting very obsessive about extreme conspiracy, tweeting for hours on end and live streaming, frequently switching dialects and accents and referring to herself in the third person, conducting journalistically styled interviews with herself.  It's probably just boredom or something, but we are middle aged now and it's a bit concerning since I've never heard her so gloomy and negative, never at all dissociative, but now so very much so. I may have missed the possibility that she has some kind of severe personality disorder. I never noticed any dissociative behavior before and she just appears very lonely and desperate about the state of the world. Anyhow, I don't know if there's anything I can do to help her. I'm reluctant to contact her directly and I'm worried sending anyone of our mutual friends might trigger her or somehow screw things up. We have one good friend I know never hurt her, but she probably doesn't even remember him. Is it a bad idea to request someone a welfare check? I'm worried to even alert her that she'll guess who did it. One of her more recent relationships ended in a mysterious death, which was probably just a suicide, but still is worrisome. I just feel so bad and I feel like I could help, but it would strain my marriage, so I don't know if there's anything I can do at all.",1
I Choose Suicide-Again! Here's Why.,1
"I chose the date to be my birthday, I'm gonna make it seem like I fell from a six story building (but I don't think that's gonna kill me? is it?) I'm not gonna leave any note, I have a few more weeks but I think my time has come.Edit: I'm a seventeen year old girl, I was born and raised in a very strict family, my teacher phycially abused me for three years with the knowledge of my parents, after that I got bullied for a full year and got death threats (parents said to not fight back) after that I started turning into some kind of bully myself and hurt so many people who used to be my friends, but then I apologized and stuff,and then I entered highschool and got bullied even more, (they emptied the trashcan over my head and then like no one wanted to talk to me or smt) I started self harm but was afraid someone would find out (even though it was on my thighs, and I'm not allowed to wear shorts or skirts or watev) you'd think the reason for the suicide would be all the abuse and bullying and childhood memories, but no, it's actually me. I could've fought back to those bullies, I could've been stronger, but all I turned out to be is weak and weird and depressed. I've been counting the number of ppl I talk to on a daily basis for the past few weeks and the max number is seven :))))Oh and before I finish, we don't have ""clubs"" I could join in my school, we don't have school counseling, I don't have friends, my father doesn't believe in psychology (he believes in violence...) I can't move out once I'm 18 because bruh it's the middle east. The only good thing I hope my suicide will bring is freedom for my other sister who really deserves a better life. ",1

"I cried in my car today about how unfair it was that I can't kill myself because it would hurt my family too bad. My brother has learning disabilities, obsessive thoughts, social anxiety, PTSD and psychosis. My dad is likely bipolar and has attempted suicide, and my Mom is just a nice freaking person. I know they care about me but that doesn't make my obsessive suicidal thoughts stop. I honestly just can't imagine how much it would destroy them. That said, this is the furthest I've planned. I'm thinking of who to leave my things with, I'm glad I done have all that much. My head just isn't in the same realm as the living anymore. My obsessive suicidal thoughts aren't even ideation but like a girl inside myself telling me ""kill yourself, die"" every 2 seconds on repeat during every waking hour. A bit of being called ""slut"" ""whore"" ""worthless"" as well. I can't shut her off. The only way I know how to stop the thoughts is to shut myself off. I really don't know if I can take them much longer. ",0

One for the next ten birthdays, anniversaries. For my birthdays, when they'll remember me. When they will miss me. For my sister's wedding.I am almost done with the crochet blanket Im making for my parents.I have fought with my parents and stopped talking to them. This gives them time to get used to not having me around.Cut myself a few times, hopefully scars don't remain on the big day.  I want to look good. That's it. Still there are a lot of items pending.. but Two weeks left. Still time to finish.",1

"I did the same thing in 2013. I did my best to accept the hospitals help and try to repair the damage I did to my body. Surviving a suicide attempt is hard, but making the decision to work past your illness and commit to life is harder. Accept the help people want to give you, and do your best to find a way through the woods while you have the support. ",1

"I don't even know what I need people to hear. I don't have anyone to talk to. No one to reach out to. No one to hear me.I feel like I have a ball of hot lead in my chest burning me from the moment i wake till the moment I fall asleep. I would say Im angry but that isn't the right word. If I let my guard down for even a split second my hands shake with rage. Im so tired of being angry.Angry at the world
Angry at the people I see
Angry at my job
Angry at my bosses
Angry at my family
Angry at my friends
Angry at my selfI know I have a good life, I know i do. I have a decent job, making decent money. I drive a nice car that im paying for myself. I live in a nice home in a safe neighborhood. I have access to clean water, and food. I know objectivly that i live WAY better than most humans on this planet. That being said...I hate my life. I never asked to be born, if i could have i would have passed on the whole fucking thing. I don't want to be here. So far as I can tell life is nothing but lonely misserable pain. I never asked for this, I never wanted this, I don't need any of this.As far back as i can remember, no one, not any friend, colleague, nor familly memeber has EVER looked me in the eye and really asked me ""Are you ok?"" My phone doesnt ring. People don't want to talk to me. People don't look for me. People don't care about me.I think about killing myself every day. I want to kill myself. Im done living. Im done fighting for my meager existance....(let me take a moment: Part of what adds to my frustration and anger at my self is that last sentence. ""fighting for my meager existance"" as ive stated before, i know that i have a good life. I really do and i should be gratefull and happy, but im not! And that just makes me even more enraged! FUCK!!! I HATE ALL OF IT, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY!!!)The only reason I havn't killed myself is because of my mother. She created and raised me, putting forth all the time money and effort, I can't repay all that by just ending my life. 
That being said what she doesn't know can't hurt her, and after she dies im gone. All my other familly fucked off to other places that I can't get to. None of them have called me for any reason in years!What does it feel like to have people love you?
What does it feel like to see that your friend is calling you just to talk?
What does it feel like to have some one tell you they love you to your face?
What does it feel like to hold a lover in your arms?
What does it feel like to have someone stop by just to see if you're ok, because ""I havn't heard from you in a few days""?I am alone. I have never formed a genuine connection with anyone.
not my mother, not my closest friend, no one.
I feel weak and pathetic, I feel like an oversensative piece of shit that just can't handle things.I want to cry untill I can't see.
I want to scream untill i can't breath and pass out.
I want my friends to call me.
I want my familly to care about me.
I want my job to not feel like slavery.
I want to fuck a beautiful person.
I want to race my car.
I want to practice martial arts.
I want to dream.I don't want to be alive any more.
Im done being angry, frustrated and ignorant. Im so confused and conflicted about so very many different things. I feel like all I truly understand is hate, rage, anger, frustration, fear, anxiety, and sorrow.what does love feel like?
what does happiness feel like?
what does it feel like to be content?
Whats it like with no stress?
What does it feel like to have no hot ball of lead burning away inside your chest blackening your flesh and buring all emotions away.No one has ever really listened to me. No one can tell me how to fix my problems, but I know of one solution.I can kill my self.No more anger
No more frustratiion
No more pain
no more lonliness
no more confusion
no more fighting
no more hate
no more anything
no more, just no moreAll of it gone, forever. I don't know what im alive.
Why do I keep trying, why do I keep fighting?
So I can keep paying my bills?
keep being rejected by every woman i have every persued?
keep fighting my own way of thinking just to people will think im normal?The futility of life is immense, and insurmountable. I don't get it, I really have nothing. Nothing of substance. Nothin that makes me happy.I have nothing
I am nothing
I want to die
I want to kill myselfAt this point it feels like im keeping myself alive out of some sort of habit, or compulsion. Like how you can hold your breath but ultimatly your going to breath again. But in some strange way i can feel my will to live seeping out of me. I'm so confused and scared and lonely. I don't know who I am, what i want, or where im going.

I just feel like it'd be just easy and peaceful and I wouldn't have to think about this anymore. But I know this feeling comes and goes in stages. A little while of this and a little while of feeling normal,but the little whiles of this are stretching out longer and longer.

What the fuck is this world and why is it so void of reason.",1
"I don't feel worthy of killing myself. I've always had people surrounding me, a loving mother and brother, a few good friends and nothing traumatic has happened to me before. But for a while now I've felt the feeling that I would rather be non-existent or dead. I have multiple suicide notes addressed to many people in my life, but I feel that if I actually do it I'll still cause them a lot of traumatic harm. I just don't know what to do with myself. I feel like if I died of natural causes then it would be perfect. Like a car crash or something. I have a friend who is also at risk, and I feel that if I did it then I would be selfish towards her. I've only now started trying to get myself help, and it's my first post here after lurking for a while. I'm going to see a councilor soon and see if they can help.",1

"I don't get it. I just want to die and someone who doesn't want to be with me keeps trying to make my life better. I just can't understand. I hate my life so much. I haven't done much with it except write a few stories here and there. I'm not confident in my future. I hate when people leave me because they don't think I'm right for them, even though they say I make them happy and make their life better. I'd rather make their lives better than my own. But now she says she's so committed to preventing me from killing myself. I hadn't even told her I had made plans to do it in the coming weeks. I don't want to turn 22 and I want to die instead. That would be a much happier birthday present. I just can't fathom this. Why make me feel bad for wanting to be free from pain? I don't see myself doing much in the future and all I can see myself doing is killing myself in some way. ",1

I am thinking about how I should spend my last money and what I should leave for the funeral, I am thinking about getting rid of everything I don't want people to see about me, thinking about canceling everything in my life, before I actually cancel my life.In some sense I sort of want to live, but I just have to accept that, I really don't, like I kinda like somethings about life, somethings are okay, but it doesn't matter, because most of my life I don't feel any happiness at all, most of my life, most of my days I only feel lonely and sad about being lonely. I will soon turn 23, and I have, like nobody I speak with, I en general have no friends in my life. I sometimes have friends in a short period of time, but everytime I start to talk with people for a period of time they disappear.

Like, I have thought alot about maybe I could just be happy alone, just be happy never speaking to people, but, I must accept, that, it will never happen, I can never be happy alone and isolated.At the moment I keep thinking about how insanely easy it will be to kill myself, like right now, I have all I need, I can screw all preparations, I can just go end it all, it's so easy, but probably also very very painful and unpleasant.",1

"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but since I do mention suicide I've decided to post this here.
I told my mom that I wanted to see a therapist back in February and she still yet has to make an appointment with one. I don't think she wants me to get help. I asked her to do this many times, just to get the same answer over and over: I will call them tomorrow/ (day of the week). I think I should just give up all hope on getting the help I need. I don't even know how I managed to stay that hopeful for so long.
There are days where I feel so motivated and have so much energy. I feel like I could do anything, such as become the world's greatest dog trainer, or one of the best magicians, or other dumb things like that. I get so much done on days like that. I clean, I talk to new people, and share my crazy ideas and plans. Then days where I feel so frustrated and depressed. I end up taking my anger out of my family, beating myself up, questioning my identity, and thinking about suicide. It's exhausting.
I do so many impulsive things and regret them later. I made so many friends last year, but cut all contact with a group of them when they didn't message me first. I broke two phones because the person I was calling didn't pick up. I adopted two cats knowing I can't be there for them all the time. (I have two cats at my mom's, and the other two cats I adopted live at my dad's. (Dad is almost never home because of his job.)) I tried to fail a certain class because my friend was going to fail and I didn't want them to be lonely. I dropped band class because the teacher told me to practice my instrument more. I stopped going to high school and joined the homeschooling program to finish my education early when I don't have a reason to. I could go on and on about all the stupid things I've done impulsively but this post would be way to long.
I'm selfish and deluded. I hate who I am. I drink Dr. Pepper to cope, go ahead and laugh at me for that but I'm being serious. My teeth are terrible because of all the soda I drink. At this point, I feel like dying is the only way out. Hopefully the cold I currently have will worsen and I will die that way.",1

"I don't know why I'm posting this seeing as I'm not looking to be talked out of anything and if months of therapy, counselling and three different types of anti-depressant in increasing doses have not done a thing to shift this feeling I doubt Reddit will. Maybe I just want to write it down for the sake of conviction, I don't know.I'm 5'5"" (male, 19) and never had a growth spurt. I can't accept that this is my maximum height. The only reason it has not been so great an issue earlier is because I was previously given false hope by doctors that I would grow while being simultaneously being put on sex hormone therapy to accelerate puberty and as result speed up the sealing of my growth plates.I refuse to live being shorter than everyone. It is something that some people can deal with but I can't. I cant go outside anymore because being around taller people makes me physically ill and can induce panic attacks of varying intensity. I haven't left my house in days and the last times I did go outside I coped only by keeping my head down to avoid looking at anybody, and piercing my skin every time I walked past a tall person.Some time this week I'm going to meet my GP and ask about being prescribed HGH in hope of alleviating my suicidal thoughts. I strongly suspect he will say no as he does not believe I can get any taller and radiologists have already refused an x ray to examine whether my epiphyseal plates are fused. I considered purchasing HGH on the black market but I wouldn't know what I was doing concerning dosage and don't know if I would get the safe, genuine stuff or some other dangerous drug. Anyway, assuming that I can't get some HGH I plan to commit suicide exactly two weeks from now.There are, of course, also other things contributing to my feeling this way but my height is by far the main issue. I haven't had a genuine conversation in person to anybody outside immediate family and therapists for about two months and all but one of my friends (who isn't aware of how I feel and hasn't met me in person in more than a year) has not responded to any recent attempt to contact them online. I am therefore reasonably certain that while nobody wants me to die, I will not be greatly upsetting any of my friends. Indeed, given the fact that we only ever talk online anymore, and I haven't spoken to most of them in weeks, I doubt that they would even be aware of it.My family are of course a different story, but the people whose feelings I am most concerned about are my mother (who would probably be destroyed) and my Grandmother (who is already unhappy at the moment on account of being ill). I am unable to cope with the pain of continuing to live, but also unable to cope with the pain of causing them such upset. I need advice in this regard, I feel conflicted between my firm intentions and what it would do to the people I love.Anyway that's the situation.

"I don't really know where else to turn about this. I've been suicidal for years now and I'm tired of people telling me that it's going to get better when the sad thing is that things haven't and things don't appear able to improve in the future. Honestly, in most of my life situations it just seems like God is a cruel little kid who builds me up for excitement only to follow it up with extreme disappointment and sadness (sometimes within the hour). It's starting to feel really fucked up; I just want a win for once in my life.
It dawned on me last night that the only reason for me to not go ahead and just end my life is the effect it would have on my family; which means my only purpose is to just exist in pain and not cause any to others. I don't want to hurt my mom with my death but I really don't think I can do this for much longer. I know this all sounds so selfish but I'm just looking for a reason to live.

I have bipolar disorder, I feel like a burden to others at times, my ex broke up with me because she couldn't handle my illness. But mostly I don't want to live with this illness. It presents many challenges mostly to relationships which is a huge problem for me since I've always wanted to get married and have children (not to mention I could pass this illness to my children, oh god) I'd rather not live.

"I don't think I want to die, but I don't know. Really I'm just very tired and I want to rest instead of keep fighting. I've had mental health issues for twenty one years now and it works in a cycle. For a few months I'm alright, just low grade sadness and anxiety, but I can get through my day and enjoy life. Then it hits and I don't like food, I'm not hungry, and most of my resources go to fighting intrusive thoughts about hurting myself. In the first stage I fight those thoughts by pointing out that I shouldn't hurt myself. In the second stage once the first one fails, I argue against the methods as they are not practical or would not work. In the third I focus on my family and the way it may hurt them. If the third stage ever fails, I will probably be dead. It lasts from days, to weeks usually until I'm out of the pit and back on steady ground.Problem is, I don't want to keep fighting this cycle. I don't want to screw around with medication until I find the right dosage. I don't want people who don't know the extent of this problem to judge me or decide what's best for me either.Example: I discovered two puffs of devil's lettuce wakes some part of myself back up. I stopped crying around 10 or 11, and now at 29 I cry maybe once a year or less. Not for lack of trying, just... I can't cry more than a few tears. I also don't have many urges to protect myself or fight back. But two puffs and suddenly I could sit and cry for a half hour with tears. Suddenly I don't want to be snapped at and abused, so I reflect it back on people who try. Husband was ecstatic because he 'had his wife' finally, instead of brief glimpses of me.But a co-worker? They decided that the smoke caused panic attacks. And no, I didn't smoke at work. Only at home, and I washed well, but they said I was causing an allergic reaction in them. So quit or get a random drug test. Same person who says I can't have Bipolar II because in the two years I've worked there, they've never seen a manic episode in me. Nevermind the month or more I stopped sleeping in Junior High.She and the Boss know what's best so no more smoke, go get more pills and hope for the best.That was Monday. Since then I've taken a lot of my medicine. I had something that helped. I don't want to fight anymore. But it doesn't do much. Trouble breathing, heart feels off, muscles keep spasming or arm twitches. Eyes dilated. It's uncomfortable and even painful, but it's been three days.I just don't want to fight anymore.",0
I don't think I'm going to kill myself tomorrow.,1

"I don't think I'm your typical depressed person. Or maybe I am and just don't realize it. I've been very depressed since I was about 16, I'm now 25. I don't have the support system I wish I did and I don't have the money for a therapist. I drink, smoke weed, and take prescription pills to cope.(I don't buy these things my boyfriend does and I just take them because I'm the worst person on the planet) So I guess I'll start with the reasons I think I'm so depressed. When I was 16 I had what I thought was the perfect life with the perfect parents. Until the day my dad left my mom. It was totally unwarranted. I even remember me and my sisters laughing at him because we thought it was a joke. NOT A JOKE. Fast forward to now. I found out he had been cheating on my mom for 6 years. My mom knew nothing. My parents ""friends"" decided to leave her in the dark till after the divorce was final. Being sixteen and going through that was hell for me. I remember trying to cut myself but I was too scared to cut too deep. All I ended up with were little cat scratches on my wrist. Real edgy. Anyways, so I've also been in love with someone for eh 9 years. The problem being this person lives in a different country. He had no intention of moving to the states(can't say I blame him). And to be honest if I were to move there I don't think he would want a relationship with me even though we talk frequently . He tells me loves me from time to time but that's easy to say when you know you'll never actually have to deal with the consequences of telling someone that. So just about every year-two years I skip from relationship to relationship. I think So I don't get attached. I dk but it's really hard on me mentally and it's even harder because I don't truly understand why I do it.Okay so fast forward to last December. I found out I was pregnant. It was a weird feeling. I was so overjoyed I think because I thought it would give me purpose. I had just started a new job and didn't want to tell them immediately so I hid it from them. It was hard to schedule the necessary appointments that way though. One morning I woke up at 3am with horrible cramps. I didn't fall back asleep. I was getting up and around for work at 6 and I was spotting so I called into work. I told them I thought it was an ovarian cyst. When I got to the hospital everyone was really nice(I think they already knew what was going on). Fast forward to getting an ultra sound and sitting there waiting 5 hours. I found out that the fetus inside me was dead. Who knows how long I had been carrying that thing inside of me dead. They gave me my options and I told them I would think about them, make a few calls to my insurance provider, and let them know tomorrow. They sent me on my way. At 6pm that night I had a miscarriage in my bed. It was the most painful thing I have ever experienced . Now I'm pretty traumatized. I mentally can't have sex anymore and it's been putting a huge strain on my relationship.So, I bought a gun. My boyfriend thinks it's because I want to practice shooting. The real reason I bought it was because I figured that would be the easiest way for me to kill myself. The problem is i'm not afraid of death. I could put a gun to my head and pull the trigger right now. The other problem is that I am an empath and I know killing myself would hurt a lot of people. It's not their fault they don't understand how much pain I'm in. I've tried to explain but they just tell me in sad and it will pass or maybe I should get some help. Well it's really fucking difficult to get help when I'm barely paying my car payment, car insurance, phone bill, and rent. Plus gas for the hour to and from work ride I have m-f. So I guess I should explain how my title is involved. A few days ago I found out someone I graduated high school with committed suicide. My family has known his family forever but we weren't ever really friends. I found myself crying all day long over this person I was never friends with. I realized I was crying because I was envious. I wanted the courage he had to go through with it. I really don't want to be here anymore but I don't know how to turn my conscience off to go though with it.I don't know what to do anymore. All I think about is killing myself. I want it so bad. I don't know if I'll ever have the balls to do it or not. But thanks for reading anyways. And if anyone has any advice or anything to share I'd love to hear it.",1

My mom told me that she didn't know if she would be able to go on living if I killed myself. My dad said about the same thing, and that's really the only reason I haven't killed myself. I don't want my peace to intrude on someone else's happy life. Both of my parents hate their jobs and are single and kind of lonely (though they try not to be) so I really feel like I'm a quarter of all they have left in this world (the other quarters are my siblings) ",0

That's just how it is.Mania is false happiness. I haven't been happy since I was a 10 year old kid (and I'm 26 now.) All of my friends left me when I was 10 and I've never been able to make friends after that after many, many attempts at making them. And my parents and brother don't give a shit because they don't have bipolar, let alone depression. So I have no one in my life to support me. Well, I do have a therapist, but what does she care... She just gets paid lots of $$$ to talk to me for half an hour.No one gives a shit about me because there IS no one in my life who CAN give a shit about me. That's the thing. In fact, if I off myself  like I want to, no one would even know. Or if they did know, they would be like ""oh well. this person was a waste of space anyway. Natural selection; cleaning up the gene pool.""My mood stabilizer certainly doesn't stabilize my mood. My antidepressant certainly doesn't do anything for depression.

"I graduated college with a liberal studies degree like a fucking idiot because all the stupid college advisors, parents etc assured me that I would be fine and I wouls get a job. It's now going on 6 months and the only jobs that i can get are shitty customer service jobs which I rathee kill myself then take. Why do people bother working when that is literally all they do? I can't grasp it for the life of me and nobody else in my life seems to understand the issue. I rather die then sell my fucking soul. I was at the top of my fucking class, I wrote an award winning thesis. Now I'd be lucky to get a job at fucking walmart. College got me absolutely nowhere. I would be better of it I didn't go with my current degree. If I could go back in time I wouls have went into a STEM field. But it's to fucking late not. How fucked up is society that you have to make the most important decision of what you want to do for your entire life at 17 fucking years old. Fuck the world, fuck our shitty dreamboat education system. I can't live like a useless sack of shit any longer",1

"I grew up for eight years with a mother who has BPD. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a incredibly abusive and toxic personality disorder.
My Father allowed this for years, until she attempted suicide underneath my bed on one Thanksgiving and was removed from my home.Following this I grew up with maids and nannys because my father was often at work. One of them was abusive towards me for serval years but never left marks on my body. My father never believed me. So when CPS came over (as they did multiple times) nothing was ever done.I was sent to a boarding school for two years when I was a teenager by my ex stepmother. Whom my father married after knowing her for a week on eharmony. Really fucked up place. One of the staff members that managed me actually gave birth to a child under her dorm room deck and left it there to die (Google: Jesscia Bradford, JYA), no one noticed until it started it stink.As an adult. It look me awhile to get used to being a person again if that makes sense. 
I took some LSD, went to some amazing music festivals.
I stopped drawing as often and became an aerialist, it was extremely cathartic. Doing it professionally across the country helped me see and experience a lot.Starting last year I cried about it a bit, then got over myself and became a stripper.
Gigs alone were good money but weren't enough to keep me moving forward in life while in a stable place. Also my father had quit working at that point because of his depression, my family was living off of food donations at home. I knew I needed to do something for my future that was fast money.
 The job itself can be pretty depressing (sometimes hilarious), but overall excellent money.
I worked hard for a year. I bought a car, payed off all previous medical debts, furnished my apartment..Things were finally starting to look up for me. I was finally starting to get stable and then start saving to go back to college.
Then I found out my family had lost health coverage because my father quit paying the bill six months ago, I was once again swamped with medical debts that were not my fault (also may I add I found this out after I had loaned him money for his car payments that month, he knew what my job was)  this time.I injured myself while training last month. I have no health insurance to get treatment, I cannot walk around to go make money to afford the treatment or get another job. I have 1000$ saved and that will only get me an MRI.
My county indigent will not take me. I make too much per month.
 I cannot find a sliding scale clinic in my county who does orthopedics.I am 24 years old now. I have tried, and fucking tried my best. I think I'm ready to go. I just got my DL two years ago, I have nine credit hours in college, and my father spent my inheritance. I'm tired of men touching me who don't give a fuck about me. I'm tried of feeling alone with no one to turn to for help. I'm sick of feeling trapped.
If I have to live in a country where people are so selfish for resources that we don't even have tax paid universities and tax paid doctors... I don't think I want to exist in it anymore. 
If letting twenty different men a night suck my tits is the fastest and most efficent way to pay for these things, rather than being stuck in debt for years with no place to live in the meantime... It's the kind of tired that sleep won't fix.",0
"I guess I just wanted to date in high school, or at least before 22. I've always been a hopeless romantic guy (emphasis on the hopeless) and I've always went way overboard when it came to getting crushes and naturally, I've scared everyone I ever had a chance with off long before I did anything like dating them. Now I'm 80 pounds overweight and depressed and anyone I find attractive is way out of my league at this point. That's probably my fault too though, I could date a girl I find unattractive but would that be fair to either of us? I'd rather rot to be honest. Not to mention I have no idea how to talk to women, I'm worse than the classic nerd paraded on television (ironically one I used to call over exaggerated haha...) and I stumble, fail to make eye contact, and forget what I'm saying constantly even when I have no romantic intentions. I'm pathetic I guess, and one way or the other life has helped me fuck myself so I guess I won't die a virgin after all. After 1 near attempt earlier this year I think I'm ready, hopefully I won't pussy out this time and actually get the gun. The problem is if I get the gun and don't go through I won't have enough money to live so I'm too poor to kill myself hahaha. I know this is a stupid reason to kill myself, and I do have others but I was just focusing on this one tonight in particular but it doesn't matter because I'll be dead either way if all goes according to plan. Sorry for those of you that read this mildly depressing rant, was just looking for a place to fulfill my narcissism.",1

"I guess I'll preface this with the fact that I am a 22 year old female. I recently got alternatively certified to teach in TX. Without doing research on the school I accepted a job as a 4th grade teacher in a shit town in South Texas called Victoria. The situation I was placed into was dismal at best. Everyone on the 4th grade team was new, 2 of us first year teachers, the other new to the district. We were given very little guidance or instruction. The job wore at me, I couldn't sleep at night I woke up every hour with horrible anxiety. 4 months previously I had met the man of my dreams, he didn't have it all together but we fell in love fast and hard. He had decided to take a job where he'd be on the road traveling installing turf. His job kept falling through little by little and he wanted to be with me in Victoria. One Friday the overwhelming stress of the job got the best of me and I made the mistake of telling another teacher at the school that of I had a gun I would have already killed myself..
Counselors and interventionist a stepped in and escorted me to a crisis center via cop car. Shortly there after my boyfriend decided to quit his turfing gig to come be with me thinking he'd easily find work... Which wasn't the case. He ended up doing day labor for 10-12 an hour... But depressed i still was. I scored a job as a restaurant manager, but through my Depression I couldn't think clearly and the job seemed overwhelming and too much as well. I ended up realizing I needed professional help. And my parents are in a position to help so I called them and I left and went back to the DFW. Leaving my boyfriend in victoria tx, almost broke. With no job and no one to help him like I have... He took a weed charge for me near San Marcos and then got another ticket for driving with an invalid license. So he has all this court stuff to go to in South TX and anyone he knows is in North TX. I haven't felt myself in a long time. I feel incredible guilt and shame and resentment towards myself for my inability to keep it together. I have suicidal thoughts daily. I've lost 10 ppunds from not eating properly. Worst of all is just knowing that I have essentially ruined not only my own life but his life too. When all he ever tried to do was help me and he believed me when I said that I'd be able to make it and that he should come down and be with me. Boy was I wrong. The regret I feel for the struggle he will face is haunting. He will most likely lose everything he has worked for. His truck will be repossessed and none of this would have happened if it weren't for me. ",1
"I guess I'm just searching for some support here... I went through a period of active suicidal behaviour for 1-2 years which exhausted me to the point where I felt like I couldn't face attempting it again. Unfortunately the thoughts still haven't left, and I only feel regret that I wasn't successful. I feel very detatched and numb all the time, and unable to get the motivation to actually act on these feelings (for now) but I really wish I wasn't here. My mental health team barely see me anymore because I'm not on medication (it just made me worse) and I guess they see me as less of a threat to myself. The trouble is, every day is a struggle and I just want it to end. I don't know where to go for support because the hospital won't care unless I'm psychotic or have overdosed and I'm still resentful for them forcing treatment on me to reverse my last overdose. I feel like I wasn't given a choice and then after a few days they sent me home and made me feel like everything was supposed to be ok now. I feel like I might as well be dead.",1

"I guess this counts as a suicide note.I'm not depressed, or ill, or disabled; I have a job, friends, a home.
I want to die.I was a kid who never did fit anywhere; single parent poverty, bad estate and high functioning autism made sure kids, especially girls, didn't like me. Primary education I hated. So boring.As a teenager school was easy and being top of English made life simple. But people liked me for what I did, not who I was. Scars ran deep.I turned down my First Love as my home life was a joke( my Mother married a chronic alcoholic). Maybe my biggest regret. Hurt for years.I never realised my potential. Barely attended college. Got a position in a major Government Dept at 19 and was the youngest in its history to hold it.
 But I was immature; missed home, felt alienated in the city so resigned.Dating was a joke- Thank God for hookers.
 Girls showed no interest- I could stand in clubs for hours and never be approached. Telephone dating was more miss than hit with few second dates.
 Got in a five year relationship- went to Part Time courses with her and was talked into going to University as I did so well.She cheated on me-3 Times-I ended it. Never scored once at University. Never lived up to my potential though I graduated.
 Felt ugly and second rate so drank too much. But sobered up after graduation.
 Had to work also to support my family(Mother/Brother). Little time or money for extra activities. Joined Police- never truly liked it much though I was good. Quite a few disliked me despite my impressive stats.
 Made the classic error of getting involved with a colleague I fell in love with.Who used me to get her Ex back. Then avoided me.
 I'd left my girlfriend so as to be 'fair'. Then that same colleague got caught doing something and blamed me. I resigned in disgust just shy of my 5 year anniversary.Moved back home and rebuilt my life- even started a social club. Made friends but couldn't date as a result of the above. Just had fun.
 Got a council job I really enjoyed for years - then I rejected a woman who then set out to get me fired, along with her friends.
 My mother had a stroke and took 9 months to die. I had a breakdown and the situation at work worsened, leading to a manager nearly punching me and two camps aligned with me or her. Things worsened.
 I had to leave.Started again. Within a year got a good Government job. Good colleagues, easy work, great conditions.
 A much younger girl, stunningly pretty, made it clear she liked me from the start.
 I made my next big mistake.I ignored her. After everything it seemed wise.But my attraction grew as hers waned - now we're pretty alienated.People there call me intelligent and wise.
 I feel neither. I feel like a fraud.
Everyone likes me bar the one I really want to. Typical.
 I know that was my last, best chance at 46. Blew it.
 I'll always be second rate and second best.Last year I decided to end it with N. Joined EXIT and imported from their Chinese supplier.
Took 15g with anti-emetics, Oramorph and alcohol. Survived and went through Hell in ICU.
 Brother and friends rallied round, as did work. They thought it was a stroke.
 I recovered amazingly quickly- no lasting damage.
I lost two stone and hit the gym to recuperate. Best shape now in years.
 Women notice me- now when it no longer matters. Ironic.
 I wished I had succeeded - tired of hearing about this unwanted 'miracle'.I gathered legal drugs to end it all- planned my final weekend.
 That Friday my house caught fire and destroyed most of my stash. Living room destroyed.
 For 3 weeks I was a refugee in my own Life.
 Now I have a flat while my house is repaired.I'll end it all here.I've seen psychiatrists, nurses, crisis team, sessions with a counsellor, 2 doctors and a Locum and even a Police intervention.
 I'd to my best friend my intention(couldn't be his Best Man now) and he spread it.
 My Brother has disowned me as weak. He thinks I'm being looked after by something/one.All agree I'm not mentally ill or even depressed- put it down to 'Cognitive Disorder'.
 I just remember being so peaceful and happy the first time, ready to die. Slept happily after dosing.
 Then again in ER when I felt myself slip away into blackness.I feel this Life is empty- no viable option attracts me. It feels vaguely revolting to be here.
 I am always somehow able to fail despite my aptitude. No-Win situations are rife.
 This girl at work exemplifies this- what I want I can never have. Like she's  there just to remind me I don't belong here.
 My living this long is a mistake.I just wish to cease to exist- to leave on my own terms and time of my choosing.It's about control- the only true control I have that matters.Maybe only I think like this.But I hope others know these thoughts they may have aren't bad or wrong- they may be right in the circumstance.I'm Finished.",1

"I had a massive mental breakdown (my second) last year that lasted ALL YEAR and now I suffer from PTSD and have a form of Dissociative identity disorder (depersonalization if youre curious, i guess) and a lot of other fucking things on top of that.guys I cant fucking take this im in my senior year and i have short days but just
its like one thing after the other adding up against me and everyone's telling me not to take a gap year because it'll fuck with my schooling BUT BITCH MAYBE I DONT FUCKING WANT TO BE HERE OR IN COLLEGE OKAYEveryone tells me it's better to be in college but I actually have plans to move out of this fucking god forsaken country and leave before I get the chance to kill myself School is like half the reason i want to fucking stop everything and give up. If that isnt fucked I dont know what is. If i have another mental breakdown I'm probably going to actually kill myself. The only thing that kept me from it last time was my best friend being in my life. She's still here but if I fucking snap my mental state in half again i dont know if i can convince myself its worth it. Is life just one breakdown after another? How many fucking disorders can i accumulate in a lifetime? How the FUCK DO I GET THIS TO STOPps dont fucking tell me to kill myself it's my decision and I'm not resorting to that until I know theres no other way out",0

"I had an imagination of life and what it will be when I will graduate. It is not that. It is a nasty place full of rules. I tried to make myself accept the reality and compromise and keep going.

"I had an NDE in 2009 after an ATV accident and I remember the afterlife. It was so beautiful. No pain, complete and utter peace(for lack of a better term)My  Life is similar to a vacation where you're staying at an acquaintance's house and they tell you make yourself at home.
But you're still a bit uneasy, and you still tip toe around because you know you can't get too comfortable, and no matter how many accommodations they can provide, you know that
It. Is. Not. Your. Home.
It never will be. I will be going back home this Friday the 22nd. I already have a place, time,and plan. Thank you all for your encouraging words and support. ",1
"I had several really good friends that I was close with. When I started to become depressed, they were really supportive and caring to me and prayed for me. But I had become a toxic mood-killer that unintentionally guilt-tripped and hurt those friends and they eventually left me. One made a  about how it was an accomplishment to get rid of me, and another one told me . At this point, it just  to me to commit suicide. Why should anyone who hurt and drove away caring and loving people keep on living? What value is there in that kind of life? I've went to college and made lots of cool friends, but it doesn't change the fact that I hurt my past friends and made them leave me, so it just makes sense to die.",1
"I had trouble with the online chat, but the phone calls were better than I hoped for. They called me until I told them I no longer felt like suicide was an option. We talked about little things and big things. I really felt indifferent to it at first, but after a few minutes of talking, it was really nice to get some supportive attention. And like I said, they called me to check up on me. They called me probably once a week to once every two weeks until I told them that I didn't feel suicidal anymore. So yes, they've helped me and I will always remember what they did for me.",1

It feels like I never have and I never will fit in.

I know that everyone I know and love would either be unaffected or better off if I wasn't born. No one knows, no one can know. I feel like there's nobody's there to talk or someone who would care.

I have a best friend. She's actually my ex. We split up less than two months ago. She's a wonderful person but we drifted apart. Being how wonderful she is I decided she should be my friend. But I have a problem. She has always been depressed and has anxiety. In all our time together I was her rock. Today (tonight) she was telling me that she can't take it anymore. She wants to die. She tells me that she can't survive without me to be there for her. The things that held her in a better place were the warm touch and the feeling that I am there for her no matter what. When she couldn't get out of bed or off the floor I was there to pick her up. When she couldn't eat I made her soup to drink. If she couldn't drink I got watermelon so she could get water when she eats. I did these things because I saw her pain. I loved her. I still love her. The problem is I couldn't keep being dragged down with her. When she got bad I got bad. I kept it to myself but I hurt. I would get depressed. No motivation. No care to take care of myself. But when she was there I would hide it. So we drifted apart. We split up. I am still trying to be there for her but I can't be that. What I was. She is asking me to look after the dog that she got in the split. I know this might sound like she is emotionally abusive to some. But trust me it's not. I'm a sympathetic emotional. But I don't let anyone in. She never forced me or abused me. And now she is saying without me she will never get better. She says she'll never find anything. I tell her she will and she still has me no matter what. I just don't know what to do. When she gets this way I get angry. She doesn't see it or hear it. But all I want to do is punch a wall. In part because I can't help and in part because it's taking me down again. I need some advice. How can I help her? How can I make things better? She's scared of therapists because of a bad session. She hates pills because they make her sick. I don't know what to do. Sorry its so long. If you can't help its OK I needed to vent mostly. Any advice is much appreciated. ,0

She doesn't want help, she doesn't want me to help because she doesn't see any reason to keep on living.
I'm really scared, I'm trying fucking everything on google but she's so set on giving up I don't know what to do. I've told her I'm here to listen but she doesn't want to talk, she doesn't want to burden me. I just really need some help on what to do.
To make things worse I now live 3 hours away so I cant help her in person.
Any advice would be so endlessly appreciated, thanks",0

"I have a friend who is really depressed. She has a genetic disease that is basically a ticking time bomb. She just wants to let the disease the course because she doesn't have the heart to do it herself. I've been trying to talk her into going back to the doctor and trying to manage her disease but she won't listen. I want to help her. She has three kids, and she's basically setting herself up to die sooner. ",1
"I have a friend who, although I do not think is seriously contemplating suicide, talks about suicide a lot. For example, a few days ago, he said something along the lines of ""dude.. don't you sometimes feel like you want to kill yourself and everyone around you?"" to which I responded ""not particularly"". after which he said ""What about <mutual enemy>?"" to which I jokingly replied ""Okay, maybe him."" Other than that, he occasionally says things like ""the workload in AP Chem is so hard, sometimes I just want to kill myself."" While I think that he's just joking and that there's nothing to be worried about, I'm still worried, and he's been both the longest friend I've had so far and my best friend, so I'm unsure what to do. Any help? ",1
"I have a note titled ""Before I Go"" on my phone. In the note is a list of all the things I want to do to prepare for my suicide. It's nothing complicated or fanciful. Not a ""Bucket list"".

"I have another account that I often browse with but it's connected to my emails and usernames I use on other sites, so I made this. If this ends up too long I'll add a TL;TR at the end. Recently finished a degree. Got a basic job so I can save for a flat before applying for a Masters degree in 2018. I've suffered from major anxiety issues for about 7 years, mainly because I was always quite outgoing and confident, then my teeth became overcrowded, sucking the life out of my confidence. But anyway, the current issue is that just as I was getting on my feet financially and being able to dream about finally starting my life properly and paying to get my teeth fixed, my mother has pulled me into an inescapable mire. She's racked up , and counting, in rent arrears, not to mention she can't afford to pay her incoming rent (due to issues that aren't really relevant here). This has left me in a position where all my monthly wage goes towards keeping her from being homeless, which has taken away my first real chance to make a real life for myself. There is absolutely no way out of this situation. I've spoken to relevant departments and benefits experts, but ultimately all roads lead to my life being ruined for as long as she lives. She raised me, I know, and I don't hold a grudge against her. But I'm older than I'd like to admit and it has taken me so long to get to where I am, with what seemed to be real opportunities ahead of me. Now my life exists to work an uninspiring job, with zero confidence and anxiety issues that are off the charts. If I lived in the US I'd buy a gun and end it. Too scared to do the pills/whisky thing, too scared to do anything else really. And as much as people will say things will get better, they can't. I'm completely trapped in this situation, a situation I can't handle for much longer.TL;TR: After a long, long time I finally got my life on the right path, had a plan to tackle my anxiety and a clear plan to move on with my life. Suddenly my mother tells me she owes  in rent arrears and will be made homeless if I don't pay her rent and set up a payment plan for the arrears. It's taken me longer than I'd care to admit, even online, to get to a stage in my life where I could finally move forward but the moment it appeared it's been taken from me. Suicide appears to be my only option because as selfish as it sounds, I need to progress with my life and after all this time, energy and work, I can't do that. It's over for me. Appreciation to anybody who even scanned this post. And to the Mods, if this is in the wrong place, I apologise. ",1

"I have depression, there are days when I don't want to get out of bed or I can't stop crying because what's the point in trying, right? I don't intend on killing myself although to be honest I've found myself thinking more and more about how much easier it would be than my life right now. To give you some background, my year started okay, going to college to follow my dream. It wasn't great, I failed the class pretty badly but I wasn't really trying that hard so I ended up dropping out of the course with the idea that I would try again and excel. My boyfriend was an amazing person through all of this, he was always there to give me advice, comfort me when I cried, give me an escape when my house was too much. This summer I had two classes but had to drop one of them because my teacher would accommodate for my special needs (which isn't that much I think, extra time on tests and assignments and no presenting in front of the class). The second class I barely passed but only because my teacher didn't want the whole class to fail. Then I started take-two of the class earlier this year. It started okay, a lot of work and not enough time but I managed to survive. But then on the second week or so I got drugged at a party and stuff happened with four people but I don't remember most of it or who knew about my mental state. After that I missed two classes because of doctor's appointments and trying to deal with related things. After I told my boyfriend he was afraid to let me out of his sight for almost a week but I didn't mind, it felt safe and I wanted that. I kept trying to do well in class but it was hard with so many distractions and I didn't feel well because of the medication I went on for what had happened at the party. My boyfriend has also been in school but his grades have been slipping. I want to tell myself that it's not my fault he's so distracted now but I just can't find it in myself to believe it. Then within the last three weeks my best friends tried to hang himself (unsuccessful), my boyfriend is becoming increasingly depressed, saying he wants me to give up on him and constantly mentioning killing himself, and I'm constantly thinking about how much easier it would be for me to just stop existing and trying and putting so much effort into making things better only to have them get worse. Now to make things better, I just got my grades back for the first section of the semester and I did even worse than last semester (and this time I tried to do better), both of my teachers think I'm suicidal and notified the school about it, my parents made me start mood stabilizer meds to try to help even though I didn't want them but I didn't get a choice. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I can't help anyone else with their problems, I know I need to try to fix myself but I have no fucking clue how and the only person I have to talk to only listens to my bullshit because I pay her to (therapist). I feel completely lost, everything I do ends up making things worse, I can't help anyone because I'm too broken, I can't help myself because I don't know how. The only good thing I feel in my life right now is my boyfriend but his talk about killing himself don't sound much like idle threats (the kind like if I wasn't there for him I don't think he'd be around much longer) and they scare the hell out of me. I'm so tired, I'm tired of pretending I'm okay because I'm really not, I'm tired of people caring all of the sudden now that I've stopped pretending, I'm tired of feeling like I don't have a voice or a choice, I'm tired of feeling unloved, I'm tired of life...",1

I have chronic illnesses along with a host of other problems with my life circumstances. There is no hope for a better future. My parents don't understand how difficult it is for me to live. I tell them but they tell me maybe a miracle will make me better. I know this is not possible but they are in denial and insist God will help me. Of course, this is ridiculous. I want to die but I can't think of a reliable way. I'm so scared of failing and being in a situation where I can't even make an attempt again. I just needed to let this out.

"I have never been a happy person. For no good reason I have always been depressed, frustrated and sad. I have great family who would be devastated but they don't need me and I know they'd be better off without me and my problems in the long run (LOL how cliche). I've spent years in therapy (how middle class), I've been on so many anti-depressants with varying results. But no matter how they have made me feel, I have never been able to resolve my long standing issues with anxiety and depression and my inability to function in everyday life.I know deep down that it's over for me. The hope for a life that I can enjoy and be proud of is just a pipe dream. I have a suicide plan and have gone through the motions over a dozen times but when it comes to dropping there's a part of me that just can't let go. I just want to go but don't have the courage or selflessness to do it. I have been this way since I was about 13 and I'm 30 now. Sorry to bum you out, but I can't really talk to non-professionals about my problems in real life because they would freak the **** out. But I guess I wanted to see if anybody else feels the same or if anyone had advice about how to deal with that emptiness you get when you want to be gone but are still here.Thanks for reading.",1

I fantasize about death and committing suicide on a regular basis. I'd just be interested in hearing other people's opinions as to why life has any reason to continue it.

"I haven't been diagnosed but I'm probably depressed. My emotions mostly feel like trying to see through waxpaper, but lately I've been see-sawing very badly. I whiplashed today and almost quit my gym workout. I got a wave of self consciousness and defeatism before I left my house, pissed off at my appearance not being what I want it to be and having no control or recourse. Not obesity or anything, but just genetic traits. I get angry I can't achieve the appearance I want without a ton of effort, I can't imagine how it is for women to feel something like that daily. I will certainly never downplay their self consciousness ever. I think I have a narcissistic streak that kicks in as a defense mechanism from accepting that I'm a total failure piece of trash (I know that I am not, but facts don't matter when feelings are involved). As soon as I got out of the shower after work, I looked at myself, trudged through my routine and felt totally drowned in hopelessness.Then I felt physically nauseous & weak, and had a suicidal thought on a treadmill. I have no idea what happened, but I finished my workout and I seem to be ok now. I had a couple friends from years ago show up (as they do regularly) so I sort of had to snap out of it. For some reason I wanted to explore the idea, I visualized doing it with a gun in my room. I won't go into the details not just because the rules say not to, but I wasn't really interested in the effect on me. For some reason my mind was immediately picturing my parents hearing a loud bang and feeling their gut drop through the floor at the suspicion of what I did, then rushing over to finally see it. It was less a taunt for me to do it but something my mind wouldn't let me get away with without going all the way. It was a morbid curiosity that spawned from an intense wave of raw self loathing. It's so odd because I was generally  30 minutes before this happened.I think I just can't accept that I won't be what I see in my mind, I don't get the attention I feel I ""deserve."" I  ignored and I don't know what to do. My life feels incomplete. I don't know how to get to stage 2, I'm surviving but I'm not ""living"", and don't feel in control enough to adequately improve my life. But I SHOULD be in control, I'm an adult, I'm a  who is trying to be in the top 10%. I look in the mirror and see 2 people depending on my mood balance. I see a somewhat handsome man ready to take on the world, and other times a man who is deluded, afraid, and hiding - and the world by not giving me any attention is feeding the latter self image.",0

"I honestly never thought I'd be typing on this subreddit. The fact that I am, makes me feel even worse. I feel guilty because part of me loathes self-pity, but I am scared that one of these days, I might actually do something really dumb. That's why I'm here. This is my first post on this site. I literally made an account so I could talk to someone. To give a little bit of a backstory, because I didn't just wake up like this, will probably be helpful. I have a history with depression and anxiety. I have a history with abuse. Self-abuse/ self harm, abuse from others I've been romantically involved with, and sexual abuse from my childhood. Now on paper, or online, that all seems really dark, and it is, but it doesn't encompass who I am, and looking at me, you'd never be able to tell. I'm an above average attractive 24 year old woman. I have very strong metaphysical beliefs and I honestly believe in the good of mankind. I'm intelligent, I've had to fight to get where I am mentally and emotionally, to come off as really stable. I moved states a year ago to start over and moved to an amazing major city with $400 in my pocket and I made a life for myself here. I finally started living a life that I thought I deserved. A month ago, a girl I've been friends with said to me ""I honestly don't how you're so stable!"" and inside I chuckled to myself because she, like everyone else, only sees the surface. I'm what you'd call a ""functioning depressive"". To put things in perspective, if any of you have ever taken a meyers-briggs personality test, I'm an ENFP. Robin Williams was an ENFP. My number one goal is for people to not see me suffer because I never want to make anyone sad. I hate asking for help. I hate telling people I'm sad to guilt them into wanting to be around me. I know it's very self-destructive. I'm a very self-aware person. I was in counseling and also saw a psychiatrist about a year ago because I barely felt like I could keep my head above water. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder with depression an a general anxiety disorder. I scored very high on a dissociation test - I would be in the middle of work and kind of black out and forget what I was doing two minutes later. I've almost gotten in car accidents because of that as well. It makes me seem very space-y and ditzy at times, when really I just go somewhere in my head without my permission because it's how I learned to cope with trauma as a child. My best friend tried to kill herself last December as well. She's my roommate, and I found her in the bathtub full of blood, and had to drive her to the hospital after it had snowed 6 inches the night before. December of '16 was my bottom. So, I started medication. To be honest, it really fucking helped. It got me out of my head enough to focus on my job. I got back together with someone who I was very fond of that initially ended because of my instability, and things were going great. I felt like November / December 2016 was my ""bottom"" - and I fought my way out and got to a stable place. Then May '17 happened. I started to wean back on my medication because I didn't feel like myself anymore. I was still in counseling trying to cope with what happened to me in my childhood, and deal with that, but I didn't feel any emotions. I couldn't cry anymore. I would be in a room full of people, having an amazing time, and pretending I felt something. So I started to correctly wean off of my meds. I had been on them for less than a year, and I read how to properly decrease my dose to avoid harsh side-effects. About a month after I completely quit, I felt back to ""me"" - without the up's and down's. I could paint again (I paint quite frequently, and the medication made me not want to do that anymore), I could cry, and most importantly I could feel things. But it got worse. I couldn't control my emotions anymore in a responsible way. I would lash out at the people I cared about. About what? I mean, 50% of it may have been legitimate things. Part of subconsiously hating yourself is attracting not so loving people into your life OR people who are just as good at suppressing emotions as you are. 50% of it was also me lashing out because everything the medication suppressed was and is now at the surface. So I ruined a relationship with that guy. He won't speak to me anymore, which is fine, I don't think we were meant to be romantically anyways - but I apologized to him a month and a half later for the bad fall out we had and he never said anything. I felt really stupid for that and internalized it as something very idiotic that I did. I have always tried to escape these issues through relationships. I have attachment issues. My love language is ""quality time"", so I tend to kind of monopolize a new person or a person I'm romantically involved with, with wanting to spend time with them, like all the time. Part of this is just how I bond, part of this is also escaping myself. I have recently been involved with a person now for a couple months. I don't know if he emphathetically understands these issues. Not that it's his responsibility to fully grasp them, but in this situation, I've tried to be very self-aware so I don't do those things (like lash out, etc). This person has been of great support to me. He has helped pull me out of neutral. I have started to find purpose in myself again, and a reason for being here. Today, I lashed out at him for something very trivial. We are not officially dating because we're millenials and it's only been a couple months, but I love his family, they love me, I love his dog, we spend a majority of our free time together, and I find that we really compliment each other in so many ways. I truly adore him. Of course there is a catch. When I met this person - he told me that he might be going to Europe for an extended period of time in the fall. So that's part of the reason we  to keep it casual, but it just ended up getting more serious, and eventually his ""me"" statements became ""we"" statements. I sometimes feel with this person I am on a rollercoaster. Once we started to get more serious, he kind of pulled back to make sure he was making all the right decisions regarding his emotions and my emotions. I respected that, but with all of my relationship insecurities, I saw it as a big red flag that he's just going to dip out come time. He's reassured me that he could never rid me of his life... but maybe that isn't good enough. I'm looking for something to give me purpose so I don't kill myself one day. I'm looking for it in the wrong places, and the wrong people, and I'm aware of that... but old habits die really hard. It's like watching a character on a movie screen make all of these mistakes, and from the theater you're yelling ""stop doing that!"" but they just keep doing it. Over and over again. Part of me thinks I should cut things off to save him from me. To save myself the inevitable heart break I will no doubt feel when he decides to leave for Europe without me. Part of me knows I lash out because yeah, I am insecure as f*** about where the relationship is going, but also because I have deep seated emotional fears. I fear that I will be forgotten. I fear that I will drive everyone away from me. I fear that even when there is a light at the end of the tunnel, my destructive patterns will not let me see it, because the dark and malicious part of my personality wants me to feel absolute misery. It has convinced me that is a safe and inevitable state of mind. Believe me when I say, if you met me, you'd think I was the queen of positivity. I want everyone to experience love and to feel loved. For some reason I won't allow that for myself and it kills me. Suicide at this point, albeit fucking terrifying for so many reasons, seems less and less terrifying each and every day. The first time the thought crossed my mind, I was freaked out. Now, it's where my mind jumps to. The peace that I would feel, even for a millisecond, of not having to upset anyone anymore. I have a very loving and supportive family, but they don't know any of this. My best friend is doing great now from her dark time back in December, and I feel like if I bring anything up it's going to remind her of that and send her into a relapse. I bottle all of this up. I even asked the guy that I'm seeing to see him because I felt scared to be alone because of my thoughts... but he said that he thinks it's best if we both have space tonight because of how I lashed out at him earlier. So now I'm embarrassed. I feel guilty for even bringing that up to him. I feel like he doesn't care. Does anyone? I guess what I'm looking for is for a reason not to do it, eventually. I'm open to... anything really. I wouldn't be here posting this if I didn't feel so low. Maybe someone can also direct me to a sub-reddit with supportive females or supportive people with experience with childhood sexual abuse trauma. I internalize everything. Everything ends up being my fault, even when it isn't, and it's a vicious cycle. I'm just hoping that before I choose to like, literally end my life, I keep going on the off chance that something good will happen. How I'm not seeing that, I don't get it. But, I just don't at the moment. ",1

She didn't thankfully but I'm still shocked about how serious she was.Another friend and I were texting with her and I ended up writing her a small heartfelt message. It was her response that got me tearing up.She told me that she was thankful for the message and really appreciative of me and our other friend for always being there for her. It was really genuine. She said she really loved us and thanked me again before saying she was just going to sleep it off. I woke up this morning to her saying she was still here.I cried last night because I seriously couldn't imagine a world without her. I was hurt. We've all got our issues but these two people are my best friends. We're still just 18 year old kids. Seeing one of them that low had really started to break me down.I don't know what else to say really. I'd like to think that what I said actually got through to her in the end and made her reconsider. I don't want to experience anything like that again. Also I'm sorry for the long post. I just feel I have to get this off my chest. Thanks.",1
I hope this doesn't break the rules I guess. I'm just thinking through a lot right now and I just need someone to talk to that isn't an angsty teenage asshat (like myself) ,0
I hope.,0
I just can't deal with living without her. Please If anyone can reach out and talk please help me.,1
"I just can't do it anymore.
Drugs really make me cope.
I don't like going to the doctors, I don't like even talking.
When I talk, someone gets pissed off.
Ever since I was a child, I would go long periods of time without talking, it just felt overbearing to talk. Like, dirty, to me. I even hate the quick convos for chatting about buying drugs. I just want the guy to set a date, and every week at the same time I pick it up, without even seeing each other or talking.
Anyways, I plan to kill myself at one point in my life, and it really just feels like a release just saying it. Thinking about dying just releases all of this tightness within my cranial cavity, and i just feel bliss. ",1

"I just can't take this anxiety i feel everyday. School is tough. Teachers are unfair to me. My grades are under average and the few friends i have bully me everyday by calling me mean things. Its not the words that hurt me (cause i know that they actually don't mean it) Its the fact that they WANT hurt me that does. I also have a very bad connection with my dad and its like i don't know him anymore.
Also, a girl i really like was the only life goal i had in life. She was the only thing that kept me going and was the only reason i got up in the morning. I asked her out and said that i really liked her and she said that she felt the same way too. About 6 hours later she texted me and said she changed her mind and it absolutely crushed me. Even though its been a while now i still can't seem to move on
I also started smoking weed because its the only thing that can give me life but it seems like im growing an addiction to it sense i feel more more depressed without it.  I don't think i will really end my life sense i know how much that would've hurt mom and she have gone through enough shit already. But Its just so much work for me to fix all of this.I hope someone cares to read this. I feel desperate Edit: before anyone tells me what i felt was just teenage love ill just say that she was more symbolic then a love interest. I loved her so i could have a reason to live. But when that failed i just became empty. ",1

"I just feel like dying right now. A lot of things add up at the moment.. I'm failing exams, too lonely, didn't really took care of my teeth and so on..
Now my recent story... I met an amazing girl..went on three dates with her..she was having a great time - laughing at my stupid jokes, very touchy and so on
But now, the retard that I am, didn't go for a kiss or anything at all while she was basically throwing herself at me..said we should see a movie at her place someday... and so on
Now she's obviously not interested in me anymore and blocked me.
I know there are more girls out there but she was the only in years to show interest in me and I'm fucking 25...
I'm not ugly but have the social skills of a flabby marshmallow so I won't meet another girl for quite some time now.
I'm not going to end my life at least for now ..just wanted to let it out because I feel like crying but can't :-(
thanks for reading..it means a lot to me since I have nobody to talk to :-)",1

"I just got rejected after my fourth job interview. I've been searching and unemployed for a month. Stuck in a house with emotionally abusive and controlling parents. Desperate to make some money and leave, but I can't.I dont know what I even want out of life anymore. I have no aspirations, and my self confidence is completely shot. I have no friends either, never have, never will. I really dont want to kill myself because I am too scared. I also think I still love my parents and my brother (who constantly berates me and blames me for arguing with my parents, instead of being completely obedient like him) and dont think I can do this to them by taking my own life. But the longer I live, the more I see no way out of this pain. I sometimes think I was just meant to eventually do it, cuz I am a waste of effort and resources on my parents. Maybe I'm too stupid to realize that yet.
Anyways thank you all for listening",0
"I just hate my self so much I can't take it. My whole body is hurting so much because I'm tensing up completely and have uncontrollable spasms the whole time.

I don't even bother to go on Facebook anymore because I don't care to see their new lives; it no longer matters to me.Suicidal thoughts still go through my head on a near-daily basis.  Never a plan, just the thought of holding a gun to my head and pulling the trigger or something else like hanging.

I guess all my friends and family members would be better off without someone constantly just causing problems and being one big problem.
I feel that there's just no place for me in this world - and I have really tried looking for it. Doesn't matter where, I'm always a misfit.The best I could say about myself is that I'm probably pretty but even that I ruined with all my self harm - so there's nothing left. I feel like unwanted and useless decoration. What's it worth to be pretty if you're just a disaster besides that.People just always leave me - and if they wouldn't my fear and knowing that they will in the end ensures it - or at least the important persons, the ones I actually really care about.
My life always just got better to only get even worse afterwards but I see an end soon. In the moment I don't even have the strength to properly and seriously consider suicide - because even that seems senseless - but I've recently just accepted that this will be my end. Maybe it will even last some more years but this is how it's gonna end. Every time something happens I'm a bit closer to ending it and there's not much left 'til I'll finally do it.
I don't see anything left I could do. I can't have any relationships anymore. I'd like to be a person that could just focus on her career but I'm too unconcentrated, too distracted, too tired, too depressed. So I'm just existing and waiting.Not even therapists have been any help, even they don't seem able to understand me and all the 'standard' things aren't working on me. My current doesn't even want to make the diagnosis because for her it seems like a lot of things - but then again not hundred percent one of them. So I don't even have some simple words on a paper describing my problem. She doesn't seem to care that I'd like to know. I should better call her the last one because this week I just didn't go for the first time - I saw no sense in this. And I guess even she is sick of dealing with me.
Everyone just expects me to 'hold on', 'try out new things', blaaa. For them it's very easy and they can't understand why I'm not full of hope because 'you're still so young'.I'm taking two antidepressants and have already tried two before it. Meditation.

I hated who I was when I graduated high school - a bunch of acquaintances and no friends. But the more I look around myself, I see that I haven't actually changed at all since high school. I hate who I am and what I've done with my past few years. I haven't been active in bigname clubs or professional organizations. I know I should ""just start now"" but it's hard. And I just don't want to do hard. The only thing holding me back from killing myself is that it's hard.I guess the problem is that I just want something easy, and life isn't easy. So why can't I just quit? That way it can be like most other hard things I've done. Hahaha",1
"I know it's going to be the way I go out. In my life I keep coming back to my depression. I have periods in my life where I'm happy. But I always come back to this. It's exhausting. And I just want to end it, but I hate that my family will be pained by it. I hate living here. I hate existing.I went to church today. I haven't gone in like 4 years. I used to be really devout. But then I fell away. Today after service they were having a time for people to come up and be prayed for. So when mostly everyone was gone, I went up there and talked to a man. He was very kind. And I just started breaking down as I said the words ""I'm just going through a really hard time right now."" And he was understanding that it was hard for me to say much more than that. And he prayed with me. It felt really relieving for awhile. Idk if God is real or not. So idk if it was Him making me feel comforted or if it was just another person caring for me in that moment as I was vulnerable.I'm just so desperate for something to make me happy again. I'm so desperate for just security again. And I hate that I'm always going to live my life doing this roller coaster. Likely after my father passes away, I'll do it. I couldn't do it to him. He's got some time left so I'm not doing it any time soon. But I'm just in so much pain right now, it's hard to function. I think if I ever did, a lot of people would be shocked.

"I know there are other people who have it worse and I probably shouldn't be complaining, but this is the lowest I've ever felt. My girlfriend of 4 years just broke up with me, which wouldn't be so bad in itself, if she wasn't also the only person I talked to aside from my parents. Unfortunately, they're not the best or even good at emotional support.
We both just moved to a new town to go to the same new college (not the same apartment) and after a little over a week broke up with me out of nowhere. This had been my longest relationship ever and we were even going back and forth with all the lovey 'love you more' stuff a couple days before. I was completely blindsided. The only thing that's worse is that she is the only person I would ever talk to about something like this. She was the best thing I had in my life, and now I have nothing. She was the thing that kept me from thinking too dark, now all I have is the fact that a life of suffering is better than an eternal void of nothing. I was told we could still be friends and to text her if I needed anything, and after a few days it turned into no responses, and then a few responses basically saying we couldn't be friends for a while and I shouldn't talk to her until we're both completely over it.
I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, or how anybody can help.  The last time I called the suicide hotline, the guy was shit and just kept telling me that therapy is the solution I need, even after I tried that and it didn't work.  Right now I just want somebody to understand how I feel because I don't have anybody left who will honestly care.",1

My mom died and I broke off an engagement and lost a job in a months time, and I guess it was too much. People are self serving and predictable, and I just can't do this anymore. I find myself researching ways to do it when Im bored. I settled on a method, Im purchasing all the required equipment now. Its so funny, this is not a rash decision, its not even like a conscience decision, but its something I know I am going to do. Look out for each other in this world.
Im quite fond of my chosen methodology. I bought a Honda portable generator and a two man tent. Im going to go spend a day or two of meditation in Yellowstone, and then place carbon monoxide warnings on the tent at night and run the generator with a half full tank in the tent. That way it will be off and clear of CM in the morning. Im going to die under the stars in Yellowstone.",1
"I know this is kind of morbid, but given that crime scene photos have leaked and that both were exceptionally interesting and beautiful human beings, has anyone explained exactly how Chester and/or Chris committed their acts of suicide?I know both of them hung themselves with simple household items. In Chris' case, he used workout resistance bands. In Chester's case, he used a belt. In both cases, it seems as though there was no significant drop and they therefore died via strangulation (cutting off blood) or choking (cutting off air), not via neck injury.I've always been under the impression that it was fairly difficult to make a reliable noose using these types of items, in part bc of the high suicide failure rate, particular among women, and in part bc I've never researched or thought about it too deeply. However, the fact that both Chris and Chester succeeded makes me think that creating a reliable device is easier than I realized and that many failed suicide attempts are not actual suicide attempts, but rather deliberate failures as a cry for help. I totally sympathize with both those who actually commit suicide and those who ""attempt"" suicide as a cry for help. I've desired the courage to carry out both types of acts in the past and can see how one may do such a thing. My heart goes out to anyone in that mental place.But back to the question, anyone on here (or elsewhere on the internet) broken down exactly how Chris and/or Chester carried out their respective acts?

Lately the impulse to kill myself has gotten a lot stronger, and I don't feel entirely safe, especially since I'm going to be living alone for a stretch in the near future. I'd like to know that I could call a hotline in case of an emergency, but I'm still on my parent's cell phone plan, and I don't want them to know if I call one. So I'm considering getting a burner phone for that purpose, but I don't know much about prepaid phones. Do I keep having to pay monthly in order to keep the number, or can I just add some minutes one time and forget about it? Do I have to activate it ahead of time, or can I wait to activate it when I need it? Thanks for any help",1
"I know this might seem like a very unpersonal question, but I am really interested in knowing the events that have led and why do other people feel like they can't just go through the next day. I am not suicidal right now, but I often find myself thinking that I should have taken more pills or should have let the blood go and cut longer. But if anyone's interested please share. YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THE FOLLOWING LONG ASS TEXT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, JUST WRITE DOWN YOUR STORY. Anyways, here's me:I am 16, male. Well if you really wanna start from the beginning, I was sexually abused from 2006 (the year my parents got divorced) to early 2010 and just when I started to understand what was going on, my grandma died so I couldn't really tell my mom because grief hit her really hard. During this time I changed schools because I had no friends and kids were really mean (I used to play Barbies with my cousin) and I started classes at this new school. As a 10 year old I loved Child's Play, Fright Night, Dracula and Van Helsing a lot so I sometimes played like I was a vampire at school, and so rumors started going around that I was satanic and that I drank blood from used tampons and band aids. Then in 2012 (I was 11) I was raped again by another man and I didn't tell anyone because I feared they'd call me a faggot again (sorry if it sounds homophobic, but thats how it happend). I started screaming at night, taking long ass showers and fantasizing about death. I started cutting my stomach. It got better for a while, I had friends, I was getting along with my family but then on February 2013 in a class trip (on Galapagos islands for two weeks) my ex classmates were staying at our same hotel. They told everyone about me as a kid and as you might expect no one talked to me for the rest of the trip. My friends kinda felt ashamed of being around me and when we got back home bullying started with jokes about my past, my weight, and a video I uploaded on Youtube about me and the ""Pear Phones"". I hid my rape story for people not to call me a fag again but they did anyways so I tried to kill myself for the first time using growth syrup. Lots of it. I just got diarreha so no biggy. After that it actually started going well. I actually was popular for a while and then my friends started making me aside and as a 14 year old the movie Thirteen kinda triggered me and I started cutting again (really superficial). Then on September 2015 my voice started to change, and I freaked out and I took the dumbest decision of my life. I decided to fake it so the change of my voice wouldn't be felt. Two weeks into class and I wanted to go back to my regular voice, but surprise surprise, my real voice was actually a lot deeper than the one I was using. So long story short I continued faking it until July 2017. On 2016 my fake voice was starting to break every five seconds and I was speaking lower and lower, so naturally people started noticing. Every oral presentation every reading out loud in class, people laughed at me. On summer vacations I told myself I had to stop faking my voice because it would fuck up everything, but as I faked it with my family I kinda found it imposible to stop. So I continued and the first week of class September 2016 we did a lot of reading as a class and that exact week I was kinda sick, so it sounded horrible. The following months the bullying was really intense. Everytime my name was mentioned or I opened my mouth people would laugh scream at me names, say that I was throat fucked up a hammer, etc. I was scared of hanging out with my friends because if I did, they would mention my voice immediately. So I was alone for a long time, but I still had hope. New Year's Eve I was walking with my pug (my literal shoulder to cry on) and asking if I would make it through this year. I was going to therapy since November because the school told my mom I was seen ""alone and sad"". I just needed a friend. I really needed one, so I thought that if I acted cool with this guy and didn't tell him the shit I did I would have one friend. Bad call. Then my mom told me we were moving to Chile on March (it was Feb 08 I think the day she told me) and I fell into a deep deep depression. I cried a lot because I didn't wanna leave my family and I still hoped I could make it work with my friends. Then my birthday came and it started going well, and me and an old friend (who kinda teased me a lot and didnt really like me but felt bad for me anyways) invited about 22 people to eat on the Friday of my birthday week. Three people showed up and they all went to hang out without me after so then I realised I had no actual friends anymore. On March 2nd one of my best ""friends"" turned 16 and I checked his page and I just checked mine again (my bd is on Feb 19) and felt really bad with myself and I just took every pills I found at home (about 16) and I took them, hoping it would kill me. It didn't. Then my mom and I settled that she'd go by herself to Chile on March 20th and I'd join her when I finished this year. So she left and I went to live with my dad and grandparents who started saying that they knew I was faking my voice and I had to speak like a man, which made me feel shitty. I also stopped going to therapy because it was to far away from my grandparents house. I started cutting again (very superficially) but I had my dog to keep me sane and unrequited love to keep me looking foward. My dog started walking a little bit weird but I thought it was just from playing with my grandparents dog and then on a Saturday his legs were not working. I rushed him to the vet thinking it was a broken leg and the doctor said he had multiple tumors on his back and coxis. I was still optimistic even though everyone said the treatment would be too expensive and hurt ful for him. I stayed from 10 PM to 3 AM cleaning his legs and body from his shit and pee and trying to make him walk. On Sunday we had agreed to discuss what we were going to do with him, so we got there on Sunday (me and my older brother) morning. They put him to sleep. I couldn't take it. My pride was just too damn big that I couldn't let my brother or the doctors see me cry so I kissed my pug the hardest I had ever kissed anyone and I left him there just when they started injecting him. I hated myself so much for leaving him alone when he needed me the most. He was there everytime I was bullied so hard at school that I didn't want to wake up the next day, and he only needed me for a few minutes and I couldn't even give him that. I sneaked in home, I got the 30 Buprex 400mg pills I bought and I started writting a note, I stopped however when I heard my dad and brother shouting if they had seen me anywhere. And I knew how shitty they'd feel if I did it so I didn't do it.The bullying started to become unberable. I however understood that the people were not the ones to blame. If every single classmate, every teacher, every store clerk, every old lady, every old friend, if everyone joked/talked/laughed over my voice it wasn't their fault but mine. So everytime it happend I would go home look at myself in the mirror and cry. I had everything planned out to kill myself. The notes. The pictures. Videos of myself telling my family that I loved them and that they should not blame themselves at all. It was June so the presure of finals and going to a new country and starting a new life really scared me. I was really scared that I would fuck it up again. The last day of school the counselor told everyone I was moving to Chile and they were all surprisingly upset. We had known each other since we were kids so I guess I could see why. Two days before my departure my whole family hired this party bus to say say goodbye. It was really loud so I couldn't speak at all. I came home and I was feeling really angry and sad at myself for not enjoying the farewell gift they hsd given me. That night I decided to try to kill myself slitting my wrists. I bought this brand new razors (I had been cutting almost daily and really deep for a while by then with this old blade) and I pressed as hard as usual, this razor was really sharp however and I bled a lot. I decided to make the bleeding stop pressing it with toilet paper. The next day my ex friend (who didnt really like me but pittied me and helped me plan my birthday) had been my best friend for about 4 years in a row and he threw me a farewell party. Out of the like 60 guests only 30 showed up, but I had a great time (because weed and alcohol baby). My cut of the night before got accidentaly open again and I started bleeding like crazy. My whole sleeve was black from the blood and there was blood everywhere on the ground. So I spend pretty much my whole party on the bathroom. The next day (the day before my departure I had to make my bags, and I was couldn't stop crying. It was about 10 PM and my bag wasn't done. My mom who came back from Chile started screaming at me. I just decided to say fuck it. I followed my mom into the living room. I said goodbye to my brother to my mom (and hugged her) and told them I loved them. I went into my room. Locked the door. Put all my stuff in a corner. Left the note in the bed. Opened the shower, ripped my crost and slit my other wrist. It was 11 PM I think and I woke up around 2:13 AM surrounded by blood with my neck and head hurting, feeling kinda sick and with my arms hurting. I don't know if it was that I wasnt thinking straight but I cleaned up the blood and made my bags. ",0
"I know this sounds odd, but it was so liberating when I determined that suicide was a realistic option for me. Now, if I lose my job, rather than trudge through the public embarrassment of losing my home and my family have to give up the cushy lifestyle we have now, or making them move to a strange city, there is a Plan B: suicide. I kill myself, and my family gets an instant financial windfall (more than I could provide in 10 years). So this realization has freed me up. Now, I'm like, fuck it. I started my own business on the side, because if it fails, who cares? At worst, I kill myself (which is an option). At best, I am successful and can make my wife and kids proud of me. Knowing that I can always kill myself has also freed me up in how I deal with people too. I've cut my abusive father out of my life because, well, why not? If all goes to shit because I cut him out, I just ""pull the plug"" and end it.Odd way to look at it, but knowing that the worst thing that can happen is I die has liberated me in a way that nothing else has. Not that I'm encouraging anyone to commit suicide. Get help. Your life is worth living, even if mine (one day) won't be.",1

Last year I felt like I was on top of the world and I turned in all my work on time, but now I have a 375 point project due on Monday (It's Saturday) I have two quizzes on the same day I am going to fail a different 100 point project, I have six chapters of a history textbook to read by Tuesday, I have band practice after school every tuesday and thursday I have three pages of chem hw due tuesday oh and i forgot to mention that along with those six chapters of the history textbook I have to read I also have an essay due that day and I literally am debating on killing myself because I can't do this anymore.

"I lost my dream job in 2009. I havent been the same since. Ever since then, things have been going downhill. My wife and I stopped being intimate. We basically existed and somehow continue to exist as roommates. She makes more money than I do now and she takes care of 90% of the household expenses. The small amount of money I do bring in goes towards my debts. I have been unable to get past the job list 8 years ago. I dont know why, but I just cannot do it. Adding to that, my health has gotten worse since then. I refuse to go to the doctor and refuse to go to the dentist. I just cant bring myself to do it. Instead, I drink myself into a stupor nearly every night and ignore the pain in my mouth and in my chest. I am now at the point where if I dont get over my reluctance to take care of myself, I wont be able to get a meaningful job or make anything out of myself. Problem is, I am so terrified of learning that something horrible is going on that I cant see past that. It occupies my every thought. My wife is an incredible woman. She accepts my faults (most of them) and is incredibly patient. I am failing her. I have failed her in the past and if I am around for more years, I will continue to fail her. And fail myself. I can no longer accept this. I just turned 40. I dont want to turn 41. On my 40th birthday, spending time with my parents and wife, I looked out over the city and decided that Tuesday was the day that I needed to let them all move on. Now it is Friday and I dont feel any different. Family have gone home. Wife has a bright future. I feel like I am just a roadblock to prosperity. I remember when I was 19 and I was convinced that I would die before I was 21. I lived a hard life and made some bad choices back then. In fact, I should have died a number of times. Somehow, I survived and prospered. Then things went off the rails again. I guess this is what happens. And at the end of the day, I think Tuesday was always the logical conclusion. ",0
"I love her with all my heart. She is constantly depressed but goes through periods of almost normalcy before sinking into depressive episodes. She constantly says she /needs/ to go and that she wants to go, that she is ruining my life by holding me back etc. (It isn't true however.) I love her very much and I never have any idea how to help; I've read the sidebar links and she hates counselling and will never go not even with me and she is firmly against using meds saying she would rather die than use them",1

To my discredit, I am not the best husband, regardless of my depression. I won't go into specifics, but suffice to say that my failings as a husband have excacerbated my wife's already potent depression.TL;DR I would rather kill myself, than admit to my wife how miserable I am.",0
I loved my ex gf so much. We dated for 3 years and I lost sight of everything in the last year. I became controlling possessive and isolating. I realize what I did wrong and have been trying to change for the better. But she won't give me the time of day. I am no contact mode with her to focus on myself but for fuck sakes it's so hard. She meant the world to me and I have tried to commit suicide twice over this. The first time I hallucinated the swat team was in my appartment and the second my parents rescued me as I laid half past dead on my couch. Both attempts were over dosing. I also survived a pretty bad car crash too so with in the last month and half i have survived two suicide attempts and a car crash and I still want to end it. I just love her so damn much and want to show her how much I changed and that I am the man that she fell in love with. I have also been cutting too and self harming. Can anyone help me ? I just want her back so badly!!!!,1

"I met this girl during my childhood, we were both 5, so we decided to ""date"" even though I didnt know what love was til I was 7.
(Dont ask why I was dating at the age of 5, I didn't know why myself ._. )
We were both 16 at the time.
Me and her have been close and in a relationship for ALMOST 11 years.
I went to my highschool, was a sophomore at the time.
I had a horrible day.
Just all these teachers were so horrible.
none of them gave any fucks to anyone.
students picking fights with me because they think I ""Act"" cool because im always quiet.
What the actual fuck, thats a reason to pick a fight with somebody?! wtf.
anyways I came back, was sooooo stressed. decided to take the anger out on the wall.
Made a couple holes, kinda calmed down and panicked cause if anyone seen that whole I wouldve been dead( I would be fine dead now tbh.)
I was so stressed, I called my girlfriend over.
She came 20 minutes later walking towards my house.
We talk, and watched videos.
She texted her father, that shes going to spend the night with me.
then its like... 11 in the morning (This was on friday)
So we were just cuddling next to eachother while watching an anime.
Then she said that if im calm now.
Then I instantly snapped and I punched the wall again, making another hole.
I dont know if I have a problem or something but, when she said that it made me feel like I went through everything again x15.
she was scared, I apologized and went to the bathroom.
She knocked on the door and said if I was alright.
I told her to get ready for bed.
I was crying of how stupid I was at the time.
I wanted to die just because of a single day of a very bad school day.
I layed down behind her, holding her in my arms and she said if im alright cause i was still crying.
I told her that school was very stressful that day.
I went to sleep, while she was in my arms.
and then around 15 minutes (Kinda feels longer cause I was asleep)
She asked if she could help calm me down.
I said it was fine she didnt need to, but she wanted to.
so, we did it.
Probably one of the biggest regrets ive ever done.
right when im about to finish up near the end, I kept going. I dont know why. all I know is it felt so good so I kept going.
she said stop once, didnt stop.
said stop twice, didnt stop
and then she yelled at me and said ""stop""
Thats when I started, you know.
after that I was breathing heavily, and then I start having an anxiety attack.
I was overthinking, like ""Oh shit I fucking cummed in her oh fuck what am I going to do what the fuck is going on""
and all I can think about is everything flashing and the noises got distorted then I heard voices in my head.
passed out and woke up in a hospital bed. I don't know what happened at the time.
anyways it didnt occur to me at the time, til like a week later and im like ""wait didnt I just have sex a while ago?""
Called my girlfriend, she said I did cum in her, and I was about to drop the phone and have another attack til she said that she wanted the kid..I wasnt ready at all.
Like il be responsible from now on if I have a kid... but if she had that kid, her life would be going through hell.
her father knew about it and was STRICT AS FUCK.
Didnt try to kill me though, just said ""if you love him, then stay with him.""
I guess I was happy..
Month later im at my friends party, drinking some alcohol.
I don't know why so don't ask if I have a problem..
I didnt feel any different though and nothing bad has happened.
I left the party near 2 in the morning or so?
Started texting my little brother, whos just a year younger than me, and I asked if he was alright.
while I was waiting for a text back, I stopped by my girlfriends house to see if she was there, asked her father and he said shes at her friends house.
I carried on walking home, still no text. I start getting a little bit worried.
I started trying to call. went straight to voicemail, and then blocked.
so I started getting really scared.
I ran the rest of the way home, thinking he was being held at gun point or some other horrible stuff.
Walking upstairs, I hear noises.
Not normal noises.
It was coming from my brothers room, I opened the door a little bit.
quickly walked in.
and at this point, I wanted to kill myself.
my brother was fucking my girlfriend.
I ran out the door. Fell down the stairs due to me thinking it was a STRAIGHT WALKWAY.
Wish I broke my neck.
I survived it, and I just ran away.
about 8/9 hours later I get picked up by some Officers.
It was a ""Search party"" for me.
Which was a waste of time.
was taken back home by my 'mom'
Went home to check if my brother was still in the room, he wasnt.
I asked where he went, turns out he went to his grandpa's house for the night.
Im walking to school the next day with my sister.
and I seen my brother, a freshman at the time.
I started running towards him and I threw one punch and knocked him out.
Went on him and started beating him to death, he didnt die sadly.
I know its fucked up, Ive suffered a lot alright? Dont blame me for his reason of almost dying.
Out of no where ""security"" stops me, I GET FUCKING ARRESTED, WAIT WHAT?!
LMAO. fucking ""Savior of the US"" puts me in the back of a car to a little private jail cell thing, was in there for a week or so til my punishment was over SOMEHOW.
I walked home.
After I go in my sister comes from the couch and starts crying and she run towards me and started hugging me saying ""I miss you""
Shes the same age as me, we're twins, Boy and girl.
My sister said I should come back later because our 'mom' was very mad.
So here I am walking in the kitchen, instantly gets yelled at.
""GET THE FUCK OUT"" ""YOU HURT MY BABY, I DONT WANT YOU TO BE HERE""
He isnt a fucking baby hes literally a year younger than me.
I got kicked out, transferred schools, and was homeless.
Walked near 20 miles or so to my new highschool, and I was waiting for the weekend to end so I can go eat breakfest, I was on the edge of just killing myself cause I was starving to the point where it hurts.
got my classes, went to eat, 5th period lunch came by, went to get lunch and then sit at an empty table not near any student, this was like a ""loner"" table outside of the lunch areas.
Girl walks up to me and I said I'd leave.
she said it was fine, nobody really goes there.
as she says..
So I started talking with her a lot.
a couple weeks later she found out I was homeless when I kept sleeping in the park near the corner of the school.
she told me she wants me to follow her afterschool tomorrow.
So I went with her, met her mother, nice lady.
She asked me a lot of questions that went between 30-40 minutes. and then finally said, that I can live there.
I was crying so hard and kept saying thank you nonstop.
Then I passed out on the carpet floor.
then I seen somebody whisper my name, which was VERY FUCKING CREEPY cause it came from the dark hallway, seen too many scary movies to know whats going to happen.
then my friend turns on the light and told me to follow her.
She took me to her room, turned on a little lamp and said ""here""
So I said thanks, then I layed back on the floor in HER room.
She was like ""what're you doing?""
Turns out she was inviting me to her bed.
and I felt like loved again, 4 months later my sister somehow tracked my phone down just to find me, it was raining, I heard the doorbell ring and I opened it, it was my sister crying.
Then she was frozen for a second, then said ""Chris"" and walked in and hugged me.
I never realized I meant anything to anyone anymore.
She told us a while later that she was being abused mentally and emotionally because she told our 'mother' that she was BI.
And then I started to get heated really quickly..
4 months later, while im waiting for these 2 slowpokes to dress out from PE in 7th period, I wait outside in the front.
Then I started looking at cars, which lead my eyes to my 'girlfriend' who came off the city bus.
I was going to just ignore her.
she sits right next to me and tries to make me talk to her.
then she said ""Chris, its a girl, isnt that what you wanted?"" (I did want a girl in the future)
and im still silent.
then she said that shes sorry and that shes stupid and how everything wasnt planned like that.
She said she wanted to ""start over"" and ""make up""
I got up and started shouting at her.
saying how could I forgive her for cheating on me WITH MY FUCKING BROTHER.
Started yelling about more shit.
then I yelled ""why dont you just go fucking die""
Started running towards the house I live at, looking back, shes crying and on the floor very red.
Nobody was home, its usually me, my sister, and my friend home first, and then 2 hours later the parents come back.
I started throwing glass.
Started ripping stuff.
Started doing all type of stuff.
I threw my piano out the window, just put it in position and pushed it out. A lot of the keys flew out.
I grabbed a knife out of the cabinent.
and I was ready to stab myself.
all you hear in the background is yelling and running.
sister charged at me and pretty much made me fall to the ground, she got on top and started saying how could I just kill myself, after all that me and her been through (Before my 'girlfriend', me and my sister would spend time A LOT.)
And she started crying , her tears went on my shirt, and she started yelling at me saying that she knows life isnt fair and always good. but I shouldnt kill myself over that, AS SHE SAID.
so I gave up and just dropped the knife and hugged my sister while she lets her tears run down.
we replaced all the glass and ripped stuff.
next day im in a bed.
Got like 29 texts out of no where from all randoms.
got a text saying ""SHES DEAD CAUSE OF YOU"" ""FUCKING KILL YOURSELF"" etcetc... then one of them was kind enough to say what happened.
My ex commited suicide the day I yelled at her.
I felt so heartbroken.
I felt so lonely and depressed.
so I decided to hang myself.
Didnt really end well.
wasnt tight enough, knot untied itself and landed face first into the floor.
Passed out.
Wakes up in bed with my friend, the one who I live with, holding my hand while her head is on the bed.
After I moved, she woke up and said ""Thank god"" and pulled me close.
I wanted to die so bad.
She said she heard the news about my ex killing herself, but doesnt know what made her kill herself.
after a while, fathers day came by.
Got SERIOUSLY fucking depressed.
Decided to try to jump off the roof.
my friend, again, pulls me from the outside rooftop into the window into her bedroom.
and she started yelling at me, saying stop. saying how I shouldnt be like this.  etc.
So I decided to change my life around.
About 6 months pass, the day I finally talked to my crush after being very shy.
Shes a very awesome rare kind of girl you find.
We hanged out a LOT.
then I asked if she wanted to go to the movies with a couple friends of mine when she comes back from her summer trip to paris, the ""couple of friends of mine"" were dating at the time but broke up later.
So I went to the movies with my friends, and picked up the girl I liked for a while.
we watched movies, an action movie, scary movie, which was my favorite thing because she would get scared and hold my side.
then an emotional romance movie.
End of the movie finally.
I pulled her closer to me, then she got up and said its almost 1 AM, and her parents just msged her saying she has to come home now.
So while we were walking back to the car, one of my friends that went with the movies with us grabbed our other friend and said ""We gotta go to the bathroom"" Just so me and her were alone.
I said ""Emma, I was thinking, what do you find in a man?""
She said a nice caring person, who was EXACTLY ME :3
Not really :/
Anyways it led to the point of me asking her out.
She just, ignored me as if I said something. She asked if I did say anything, I said no after that due to shyness kicking in.
So I asked her out right when we get out the car near her house.
She said ""Looks chris this isnt going to work out, I already like somebody""
So I was like, oh yea...thats fine.. Its alright.
I felt dead inside
next day I asked how she was, then I was curious and I texted her saying ""why wouldnt it work out"" because im stupid and she already said that she liked somebody...so I asked more dumb questions because my anxiety started kicking in and I started overreacting then she sent me a long message
""Who the fuck said I didnt care? How the fuck did I hurt you, I never said I liked you too, I never said I love you too. I never said something to you i didnt mean, but you're too butthurt to realize that. When you asked if I liked someone, I didnt lie to you, I even told you who it was""
Im bursting into tears at this rate.
Im wanting to die a lot more.
Got in contact with her crush, turns out he likes her also, so I secretly told him about it, because I made emma, the girl I liked, feel stressful, so I decided to try to make her life happy as possible.
Told her crush everything that happened between me and her, then he started getting closer with emma, and emma didnt realize that he liked her also.
Then she brought it up in a conversation we had later on.
She said  ""my friend might send him a message saying if he likes me back""
I said I know the truth, I said we both talked.
She said ""You told him I liked him?!""
I said yes, then it all turned well when I said he likes her back.
then she says ""Oh my god chris you are the fucking best""
then I said ""Yea sure I am.."", even though I wasnt the dude that she wants......
then she said ""Next time I see you im going to give you one of the biggest hugs I can offer""
Without hesitation, I said ""Save it for somebody who you actually love.""
I wasnt pissed, but I was jealous.
And now, shes lost feelings for him.
So now I feel like I wasted my own tears, and time, and effort to try to put them together to make her happy.

I miss him so much. I developed intense feelings for him over 2 and a half years and he let me go 8 months ago. The only thing that gets me through my school work is living in the delusion that I will see him again in the future if I study hard and get back to the university where he works.I feel pathetic and I actually thought about buying a rope and hanging myself. I'm not sure where I would do it though.,1

"I never know how to start these things. I'm not very good at speaking my emotions or my past. But allow me to start at the beginning. I was 10 when my parents split up. My father was an alcoholic. I'd go over to his home on the weekends. He was abusive when he was drunk, so constantly. He verbally and physically harm me. My mother met a guy, they soon moved in. We were like a family. Me, my 2 brothers, my half sister, my mother, and her boyfriend. He was abusive. Very abusive. I never got a break. After being abused by my step dad on the weekdays, I'd go to my alcoholic fathers house and get abused there. Now, fast forward to me being 11. The abuse was still going on. To get away from it, I'd stay at my cousins house. She was my age and was my best friend. I loved her more than anything. One night, around 7 PM, her father demanded she go to her room and sleep. I thought it was odd that he didn't make us both go. He made me stay. You probably know where this is going. He sat me down and explained what uncles and nieces do when they love each other. Keep in mind I was 11 and confused. He then gave me apple juice, which tasted very funny. He told me to drink it all as it would be a waste if I hadn't. I remember specifically looking at the clock and it reading 7:43 PM and feeling light headed. He guided me to his bedroom and upon looking around, I noticed a pile of white socks on the vanity. There was an obvious camera hidden in them. He demanded I undress myself then to lay on the bed. Yes, he raped me. I play this moment in my head so many times. Looking in the mirror on the vanity and seeing him on top of me; the look on my face. I was terrified, scared, and frozen. It felt like the room was spinning. After what seemed like an eternity, he was done. He told me to put my clothes on and as I was doing so, in his words he said, ""Don't tell anyone about our secret, you slut"". 
Months go by until realizing I wasn't his only special friend. His daughter, my sister, my brother, and finally, his baby niece. He's gone to prison for this. But he was only charged with raping his daughter. In prison he threatened me for telling my mother. He was released last year. After the news of my uncle molesting me came out, my father was disgusted in me. He said that it was hard to look at me. He never let me in his house again. My fathers last words to me were ""I never wanted you, just die already"". I haven't seen him to this day. He has a new family. He was my hero, my everything. I love you, Dad. Since I no longer saw my father, I was with my mother during the weekdays and weekends. She was busy providing for us by working constantly. Her husband was a semi delivery guy, so he was hardly home. I was left with my brothers. Any chance they got to sexually touch me, they took it. One of them demanded sexual favors or they would tell my mother that I've done something bad, resulting in me getting an even worse beating from my step dad when he got home. I couldn't do that. So I let my brother(s) have their way. During all of this, I met someone. Sounds a little young to be dating, yes. But it wasn't anything sexual. He was really kind to me. He's still my best friend to this day. We dated for 2 years until I left him. He introduced me to his cousin, who was our age. Me being dumb and young, I started dating him instead. After 2 years of sexual/mental/physical abuse, he left me. I felt incredibly lost without him. I didn't want to be alone. The first guy, being the sweetheart he is, was there for me. I was too scared to be in another relationship so I turned him away. I regret leaving him to this day. He's my best friend that I've always been secretly in love with. I stopped dating for some long years. Fast forward to me being 15. My mother started noticing my depression. It was becoming difficult to cover up. After a scary overdose she decided I needed to start over. She moved me from Indiana all the way to Florida. I've never been to Florida before I lived here. God bless her, she thought it would do more good than harm. I isolated myself. 3 years I was alone. I hadn't hung out with a friend in 3 full years. After many failed suicides and antidepressant medication, I found hope within myself. I was starting to become better, 'happier'. I was doing so great; but then my grandmother fell ill. She passed in June of last year. I felt incredibly lost. I loved her. I looked up to her and seemed advice from her. She was no longer with me. That set me back so far. I isolated myself again. I started experimenting around with self harm. I oddly found so much comfort in it. I overdosed on depression medication (ironic, I know). After I recovered I decided I had to do something with my life. I met a guy in march of this year. I became attached. He was into me. It was going well until he broke it off. After a month of no contact and sleepless nights of crying, he unexpectedly showed up at my house. He begged for me back. I said yes. He only wanted to be my FWB, and if he was still interested in me, he'd turn it into a relationship. I'm not dumb. I know he was using me. But I didn't want to be alone. After being isolated by myself for 3 years and then feeling what it's like to not be alone, I couldn't go back to it. I just couldn't. It was hell to me. We were FWB for a long while and I thought it was going so well. I had my life together. I was looking for a job, getting my license, and things were starting to look up. But then, last week he called me. He told me he just wants to be friends and get to know each other and then hopefully progress into a relationship. That made me anxious. He didn't want to do anything sexual with me. I couldn't read him at all. He came over today. We watched anime together. He then came onto me and sexual things did happen. Of course I didn't reject it, I didn't want to upset him or lose him in any way. After everything was done, he told me ""we have to stop doing this, we need to just be friends"". Which made me feel guilty and ashamed, even though he came onto me. I'm afraid of losing him. He's the only person I have in my life right now. He's the only one I've seen in 3 years. I'm afraid to be alone again. I don't want to go back to that dark place. I honestly can't do this anymore. I hope I will get better, but at the same time I hope I give up so I won't have to fight anymore. I have severe depression, anxiety, suicidal tendencies, and insomnia. Having one of those is horrendous. Having them all at the same time is hell. I'm writing this after taking a bunch of mixed pills. I'm laying in my bathtub, deciding whether to fill it up with warm water, or just lay here in the cold. All of my suicide attempts were in-the-moment type scenarios. This is one. I'm not scared of death, it's the dying that I'm terrified of.Goodnight everyone, and may your lives be as bright as your dreams. ",0

"I never thought I'd be writing a post here. I always thought I was strong. I always thought it wouldn't get to this. But everything's changed, I guess. My anxiety is so bad, I don't think I WANT to live with it anyone. Anything that I could possibly worry about, I worry about. My anxiety is so bad it always gives me phantom pains and I convince myself I'm having a heart attack or a stroke or some shit. I'm only 16 years old. I shouldn't be living like this. I should be like other girls, just carefree. My anxiety was a lot better for awhile, but it's taken a turn for the worse and I don't wanna live with it anymore. All my friends do is get mad at me and it makes me feel SO shitty. I put my parents through so much shit. I've had little mini mental breakdowns. I barely have a relationship with my dad. I love my mom so much. All my mom does is worry about me and she does so much for me and i've treated her so shitty in the past and it makes me feel like absolute shit. I hate that I always worry her. I know it would just be better if I was dead and gone and didn't exist because then I wouldn't be causing her pain. 2 kids that live on my street have killed themselves i know she's scared for me and doesn't want me to feel like that and think i need to commit suicide. I hate that I feel this way. I hate that i just wanna free her from the pain that is me. I don't wanna feel this way. I don't wanna feel anymore. I just wanna be gone. I wanna be free from this pain.

I hate everything about myself - how I look, how I think about things, my weirdness...Some people say I'm wrong, but it's extremely hard to believe otherwise - I'm not worth anyone's time... I'm a waste of space, air, and just everything. Regardless of what anyone says, I AM and everyone else is better off with me not being here. That's just how it is.

"I post this here as I know a lot of you would have felt or would be feeling the same. I am suicidal a lot of the time, but not ""act on it"" suicidal. I think about it, I google it, I make half arsed plans I know I won't carry through. I realise there are levels of suicidal. I have attempted suicide. I have been ""paralysed by pain of having to live and screaming in agony"" suicidal. I have been ""why doesn't everyone around me want to die too"" suicidal. But with help I am slowly improving.First of all, I'd like to say to anyone reading this, if you are dealing with any level of suicidal thoughts, they are all hard. They all suck, and just because your not actively trying to take your life, or your not bed-ridden, or it seems like it's worse for others, it doesn't make your struggles less important. You are deserving of help and support. Your problems are real. Accept all the help you can get.I'm currently ""I can stay alive because I know there are people who would be devastated if I died"" suicidal. This means that life must go on, and I have to keep moving. My question to anyone who can answer me is, how do I do this? Im a medical student, so I need to study, but so often I go back to the thought ""I don't want to be here, I don't want to be alive, how am I meant to do anything with that life?"" I understand this is a vague question, I just really hope someone understands what I mean.Thank you and I hope your all doing ok",1
"I posted here a few days ago on a different account about taking a box of benadryl. In the end i only took about a third of the box. Another friend that I love (like a sister) just told me she didn't want to be my friend anymore either today and she blocked me on social media. while i was sad and crying i ended up dming the person i love about why everyone is leaving me. i shouldn't have done that and he ended up blocking me. then i went on skype and i acidentally sent an invite (I was planning on doing that months from now, not today). Now i feel like everyone i love is gone, as my other best friend is also gone aside from the one i loved as a sister. and my romantic love is gone and i feel like a stalker. all ive been doing for thge past few hours is checking what medications i have here would kill me painlessly but the ones that would kill me will just make me die painfully.

I reflect back on my past friendships which are no longer there because I become distant and isolated from people.

"I really don't know where to start....I met the girl of my dreams 2 years ago she's perfect in every way. Just over a year ago we got together, I lost my job and had to move out in Febuary of this year it'd only been six months but we decided the best option would be for me to move to Norway to live with her full time. (I stayed at hers for a few weeks prior and she stayed at mine for 2 months plus other weekend visits etc)So I uprooted my life, loaded my vehicle with all of my posessions and literally drove for 3 days with all my remaining money etc to Norway from the UK.Since I arrived I've been trying to get work (not easy without knowing the language, although learning that at the same time). It's been hard, I was getting money from the Uk up untill about 2 months ago which was helping. However that too stopped now.Yesterday she sits me down and tells me it's not working out and she wants me to leave... the money stress has been difficult over the months and it's caused her to slowly start resenting me and she no longer loves me and doesn't think those feelings will come back and wants me out now so that I don't use any more money eating food etc. She's given me less than a week.I don't blame her for this I know it's been hard and she's been super good to me it can't have been easy for her.So I'm stuck in Norway with all my clothes, bike, pc and all my other stuff (about a small vans worth) with no money, nowhere to go, completely depressed and devastated that the woman I love more than anything has basically thrown me away. I don't know anyone here apart from her relatives. Even if I somehow manage to sell all my posessions fast then I'll be flying back to the Uk to homelessness and joblessness...I have nothing and noone wtf do id do, Don't wish to sound emo but all I can think in my brain is that the easiest solution is just to overdose and take the easy way out.

I recently started college here at Akron 3 hours away from my home. I don't drive so I'm pretty much stuck up here. I thought I would love it here the new environment and a way to make myself a new me. So far it's been the exact opposite I'm in a frat so that's cool but my classes for my major (nursing) are just crazy hard and Idk if I should switch majors or not or what to do. Idk if I even wanna be this far away from home anymore. I had major depressive disorder and anxiety and slight OCD racing thoughts mostly. I was really excited to start nursing and become a pychiatric nurse when I graduate but from where I am now that may never happen. Every day I am always anxious about either my social life or studying 4 hours a day or whatever else may happen. Lately I've just been laying in bed thinking of what to write in a note. And falling asleep thinking of when and how to end it all. I've been suicidal before and thought about it a lot really it has never left the back of my mind for 4 years. I guess I'm just bummed because I have barely any friends and having just a hard time. This summer me and my friends really became brothers and they all stayed together at local college because they don't have the money to come to a actual university but maybe they made the right decision. Idk what to think or say to my mom. Because I quit everything in life and I don't wanna quit college to. If anyone wants to talk please comment or pm me if you have experienced the same thing I am.

"I recently turned 28 and really feel suicidal for a ton of reasons.
I didn't have the worst life out there, lots of people have much worse lives then me, but I honestly feel so deeply depressed about how my life has turned out.
My mother died last year. We had a very difficult relationship. My dad went missing a few weeks before my 6th birthday (my last memory of him is inviting him to my birthday party) and turned up around my birthday in a river. We still have no idea what happened to him: if it was an accident, if he killed himself because of his believed schizophrenic disorders, murder... who knows. My parents already had a bad relationship and weren't living together at that point, but it changed our lives of course. My mother had a ton of mental health problems as well as chronic illnesses, due to having a highly abusive father growing up and a crippling injury, and my dad's death compounded them, not to mention she was raising two children on her own on benefits one of whom was autistic (me, I was diagnosed with asperger syndrome around this time). I love my mom very much, but she could be incredibly abusive due to her problems: I have memories of her spitting in my face, grabbing my hair and shaking my head like a rag doll when she lost control, screaming abuse when I knocked over a glass of water (I have dyspraxia as well as asperger's which made me very clumsy and struggle with organisation.) When I was 10 a friend of my mother's went through a psychotic episode and acted like he was going to molest me: if someone hadn't come along at that moment I still no idea what might have happened after he started hitting me on the arse and telling me to take my shorts down.
Teenage years were hard as well. My mother was very paranoid, and I wasn't allowed out the house on my own until I was almost sixteen (I had to have an escort walk me to and from school). I spent most of primary school and high school being bullied for various reasons, and I desperately wanted to make friends, yet lacked the social skills to make them: often offending people without meaning to and being incredibly defensive so on the rare occasion someone wanted to befriend me, i would often be too scared to take them up on it, or not realise it. It didn't help that mom would often prevent me from doing normal social stuff on the rare occasions I was invited. I was also struggling with my sexuality: I realised from an early age that I was attracted to boys, yet I did my best to suppress this: I was already being bullied for being the ""retard"" and the ""special needs kid"", and was often called ""faggot"" and so forth, i didn't want to be the weird gay kid as well. I didn't want all the bullies who called me faggot to be right. So I tried to force myself to be attracted to girls, even though I felt nothing towards them. It was easier to be in denial then accept I liked boys not girls. Mom was often quite homophobic: she would say some pretty nasty things about gay men, and while she had gay friends she found two men having sex to be revolting. When she realised I was gay she was quite nasty about it for a while: accusing me of prostituting myself for old men. She would go through my phone and delete messages from boys.
I also really hated my body. I often thought i was fat or obese, but this was because i developed man boobs when I was 12, and was extremely paranoid about them. Despite actually fluctuating from being very skinny to a modest amount of pudge throughout my life, I thought i was obese or extremely fat, and I've never taken my shirt off in public as a result, even though all I badly wanted to. It also made dating extremely difficult on top of everything else. It made me absolutely loathe my body. It didn't help that I had acne on top of everything else, was bullied for my prominent front teeth, and my feminine facial features. I was often mistaken for a girl. I was also born with a small bladder: until i was 14 i had to wear diapers to prevent me from wetting the bed, and had to have quite a few procedures before medication finally cured me: one of which was having metal needles jammed up my urethra when I was six. So when I finally cured one problem that led me to be extremely self conscious and miserable, another popped up, and completely ruined my confidence in my developing body that still hasn't gone away despite constantly struggling with exercise and diet. Because I was so lonely, i turned to binge eating, purging and hoarding to make myself feel better: I was so controlled in every way that those were the only things I could turn to fill the void created by my loneliness. I also hated birthdays: a lot of traumatic things happened around them: my godfather, who was the closest thing i had to a father, or indeed any male presence in my life eloped the day before I turned 15, so I had no one to teach me how to shave: my father's side of the family wanted nothing to do with us after dad died and would often try to bully my grandmother into disinheriting me and my sister, and my mother's family who I loved very deeply were on the other side of the Atlantic so I barely got to see them. I did love my only surviving grandmother very deeply, and some of my happiest childhood memories are of her. She died some years ago, and had resisted her daughter's attempts to bully her to disinherit me and my sister, though my aunts were incredibly hateful over this and did their best to remind me and my sister that they considered us thieves and entitled brats for not giving them their brother's share of my grandmother's estate. I miss my grandma so very much. She was one of the few people who ever gave me unconditional love, and sometimes I play the music box I got her for Christmas one year and think of her. It was a snow globe with her favourite flowers and bird inside it, and I feel so deeply nostalgic when I play it.
I eventually got into my dream university but because of my severe depression I would just lock myself in my dorm room, binge eat and cry, having absolutely no idea how to break out of it. I was very lonely. It ended up feeling more like the Bell Jar then my dreams finally coming true. By the time it was over I came very close to killing myself and spent most of that year in a suicidally depressed state. I eventually got to redo my final year, and made some wonderful friends who became a surrogate family. I was still sexually and romantically frustrated, due to my binge eating finally taking its toll and I gained a lot of weight during my depressive episode.
Eventually I graduated and had to move out. But i was finally happy in many ways, due to finally getting the social life I wanted: I finally was getting invited to parties and doing fun things. Mom had gotten very ill at this time, so I spent the year after graduating struggling to sort out my life and look after her at the same time: she became more and more emotionally volatile as her mental health was affected by her physical healths rapid decline. Eventually I took my life savings together and moved out, thinking i could look after her better if I had my own space, and i was tired of feeling ripped apart by loving her and resenting her for so many things. Six weeks later I got a call from the hospital, saying she had been admitted. For the next three months she was in and out of the hospital. I hated going there. I had put everything on the line to get my own place and fix my life and let go of the past, and i kept having to go to a hospital and see my mother decline, throw tantrums when she would ask me to bring or buy certain thing for her, and then change her mind, all the while biting my tongue because I didn't want to lose my temper in a ward full of frail old ladies coughing blood and even though I had really really thought i hated my mother at this point, I still loved her and hated to see her suffer so much. My mental health had already been dangling by a thread for quite some time. Eventually we got another call from the hospital, and my mother passed that evening from multiple organ failure. I remember staring at the heart monitor, praying with every fibre of my being for it to keep going, holding my mother's hand... until the nurse said her heart had stopped and the machine was switched off. I said goodbye to my mom, and felt deep anguish: she was never going to meet her grandchildren, something she deeply wanted: for all her flaws as a mother she loved children and it would have been so healing to see her as a devoted grandmother. I smoked a cigarette outside and spent the next few days crying my heart out.
Things got even worse. My mother had not made a will, and since the area we lived in, the area that had been full of stabbings all my life was now a very gentrified area, the house was now worth a lot of money: which meant an insane amount of inheritance tax. My mother was a very bad hoarder as well, so the past year and a half has been struggling to clear out her things and make the huge inheritance tax bill, the first of which came six months after her death. I eventually had to move out of my place and back into the family home due to the inheritance tax taking all my savings and inheritance.
And now? I guess I've reached my breaking point. I'm 28, still have man boobs, have no money, haven't had a boyfriend in eight years, coming up to nine, have never had a job, just volunteer work, and have missed out on so much of life. When I clear out mom's stuff and take it to the charity shop, the loss hits me: so many things are mixed up in there, and it reminds me of times when I was either happy or hopeful for the future, and it feels so bitter that i can't go back to those times. All that's left of my parents are two urns sitting side by side containing their ashes. My sister lives overseas so I have no family left in the country. I just want to redo my life and not be autistic, or gay, or have man boobs, or have had so many mental and physical health problems. Or have had more family around me growing up: people who could have gotten me away from my mother and taught me to be an adult, so I wouldn't have been so emotionally stunted and isolated for most of my life: helped me get into shape, helped me grow up, so i could have had a social life in my teens and twenties, maybe even gotten to the point where i could have had a nice boyfriend or two, instead of years of sexual and romantic frustration.
I see my friends still, but sometimes it's painful because it reminds me of how different my life has been from theirs: they had families, are in relationships are in careers and have had financial stability growing up. Some of them are going on holiday and backpacking through exciting places: yet me I am absolutely broke from having to pay a huge tax bill every year. I don't know... I keep slipping into these daydreams were I didn't have so much shit happen to me: where I am not autistic, where I didn't have such an unstable upbringing, where I met a nice boyfriend and didn't have these two things on my chest that absolutely ruined my confidence that wouldn't shift no matter how much exercise I did... a guy who I could go on dates with, play games with, snuggle up to at night and have a satisfying sex life with, someone who would take me home to meet his family. I wish my parents were still alive and had been a bit more normal. I wish I wasn't born with so many things wrong with my body and mind, that came together to make me far more isolated and sad then I could bear. I wish I had had a big family around me growing up. I just wish I had had a bit more.... stability and normality, then all this chaos.
I don't know. i am on the waiting list for grief therapy and i see a counsellor, but I feel so deeply sad about how much of life I have missed out on, and am still missing out on due to being held back by such a crippling amount of debt. I want to kill myself, but I know I couldn't do that to my loved ones.
I don't know why I wrote this. Venting I guess. I keep wishing i could redo my life. I wish some pieces had come together better. Like if I had to be autistic, I didn't have to be gay as well. If I had to lose my dad, I didn't have to lose my mom as well. That my mom hadn't had so many things wrong with her, because she wasn't a bad person, just very damaged physically and mentally. That my family in America had been around so they could have given me a bit more of a balanced upbringing: that my uncle and aunts had been around to get my mom to back off a bit, that my cousins had been the big brothers I needed to be a man: teach me to shave, take me out, helped me work out, how to socialise, that I had my baby cousins to look after, read stories too, play games with because I always wanted to be a big brother too, and was often sad that I didn't have babies and kids to look after (I have two godchildren which has been wonderful but it does make me wistful that I never had any younger siblings growing up). That I had known that man boobs could have been fixed with surgery so I knew what it was like to take my shirt off at the beach. I wish I could have more experience with dating instead of hooking up with older men as no one my age gave me the time of day. I wish I had a nice boyfriend. I wish I hadn't had a hormone imbalance that made me loathe my body and made me bundle myself up in clothes to hide it and never take my shirt off.
I feel selfish for wanting to turn back time, as the world doesn't revolve around my happiness, I just wish there had been a bit more balance? I didn't expect a happy life handed to me on a platter, I just wish.... so many burdens hadn't been given to me that prevented me from having the life I wanted.... I just wish I could redo my teens and twenties without some of them so things were a bit more bearable and happy and less of a lonely, isolating struggle. There's a lot more I haven't mentioned but I just wish I could wake up and have it be a long time ago, before so many things got worse and worse. I know it's very self indulgent because some people have it so much worse, but I just hate myself and I hate being me. I just wish things hadn't been such a struggle and I wasn't going through losing my mom and having a colossal financial crisis on top of everything else. I guess losing my mom has opened up a lot of old wounds: it's made me feel wistful for past times, and deeply miss my dad and grandma, and wish I could have had things be a bit more normal: to be a bit more like my peers, and be in a bitter place to cope with this loss now.
I wish it was years ago. Making my grandma a cup of tea and sitting in the garden with her. Or playing Ocarina of Time for the first time. That magical moment when a boy kissed me for the first time. Time passes. It feel so strange there was a time when I was a child. Or a young teen. Or a twenty year old, and I actually had hope that things would get better instead of so much worse. It feels sad that I feel nostalgic for those fleeting moments of happiness in a life I've found often so very sad and unbearably lonely. I feel like wanting to hit the reset button makes me a bad person: it's impossible and selfish like the whole world revolves around my happiness. I can't help it though: if I could make those daydreams of being young and in love, and having my family be more normal and alive around, and getting to be more social as a teen and twenty something happen, I would.
I know it's a lot of whine here, but I guess I just wanted to get things off my chest. I know I have to a accept the past and that it's gone and it's written, but I just wish things had been less awful. I keep thinking: if this was how my life was going to be, why was I born? I didn't ask to be an orphaned gay autistic man child with tits from a poverty stricken, unstable background that's never been in love and has been so very very lonely for almost my entire life. Sometimes I wish I'd never been born or I'd killed myself years ago. Thank you for reading.",1
"I recently turned 28 and really feel suicidal for a ton of reasons.
I didn't have the worst life out there, lots of people have much worse lives then me, but I honestly feel so deeply depressed about how my life has turned out.
My mother died last year. We had a very difficult relationship. My dad went missing a few weeks before my 6th birthday (my last memory of him is inviting him to my birthday party) and turned up around my birthday in a river. We still have no idea what happened to him: if it was an accident, if he killed himself because of his believed schizophrenic disorders, murder... who knows. My parents already had a bad relationship and weren't living together at that point, but it changed our lives of course. My mother had a ton of mental health problems as well as chronic illnesses, due to having a highly abusive father growing up and a crippling injury, and my dad's death compounded them, not to mention she was raising two children on her own on benefits one of whom was autistic (me, I was diagnosed with asperger syndrome around this time). I love my mom very much, but she could be incredibly abusive due to her problems: I have memories of her spitting in my face, grabbing my hair and shaking my head like a rag doll when she lost control, screaming abuse when I knocked over a glass of water (I have dyspraxia as well as asperger's which made me very clumsy and struggle with organisation.) When I was 10 a friend of my mother's went through a psychotic episode and acted like he was going to molest me: if someone hadn't come along at that moment I still no idea what might have happened after he started hitting me on the arse and telling me to take my shorts down.
Teenage years were hard as well. My mother was very paranoid, and I wasn't allowed out the house on my own until I was almost sixteen (I had to have an escort walk me to and from school). I spent most of primary school and high school being bullied for various reasons, and I desperately wanted to make friends, yet lacked the social skills to make them: often offending people without meaning to and being incredibly defensive so on the rare occasion someone wanted to befriend me, i would often be too scared to take them up on it, or not realise it. It didn't help that mom would often prevent me from doing normal social stuff on the rare occasions I was invited. I was also struggling with my sexuality: I realised from an early age that I was attracted to boys, yet I did my best to suppress this: I was already being bullied for being the ""retard"" and the ""special needs kid"", and was often called ""faggot"" and so forth, i didn't want to be the weird gay kid as well. I didn't want all the bullies who called me faggot to be right. So I tried to force myself to be attracted to girls, even though I felt nothing towards them. It was easier to be in denial then accept I liked boys not girls. Mom was often quite homophobic: she would say some pretty nasty things about gay men, and while she had gay friends she found two men having sex to be revolting. When she realised I was gay she was quite nasty about it for a while: accusing me of prostituting myself for old men. She would go through my phone and delete messages from boys.
I also really hated my body. I often thought i was fat or obese, but this was because i developed man boobs when I was 12, and was extremely paranoid about them. Despite actually fluctuating from being very skinny to a modest amount of pudge throughout my life, I thought i was obese or extremely fat, and I've never taken my shirt off in public as a result, even though all I badly wanted to. It also made dating extremely difficult on top of everything else. It made me absolutely loathe my body. It didn't help that I had acne on top of everything else, was bullied for my prominent front teeth, and my feminine facial features. I was often mistaken for a girl. I was also born with a small bladder: until i was 14 i had to wear diapers to prevent me from wetting the bed, and had to have quite a few procedures before medication finally cured me: one of which was having metal needles jammed up my urethra when I was six. So when I finally cured one problem that led me to be extremely self conscious and miserable, another popped up, and completely ruined my confidence in my developing body that still hasn't gone away despite constantly struggling with exercise and diet. Because I was so lonely, i turned to binge eating, purging and hoarding to make myself feel better: I was so controlled in every way that those were the only things I could turn to fill the void created by my loneliness. I also hated birthdays: a lot of traumatic things happened around them: my godfather, who was the closest thing i had to a father, or indeed any male presence in my life eloped the day before I turned 15, so I had no one to teach me how to shave: my father's side of the family wanted nothing to do with us after dad died and would often try to bully my grandmother into disinheriting me and my sister, and my mother's family who I loved very deeply were on the other side of the Atlantic so I barely got to see them.

I had put everything on the line to get my own place and fix my life and let go of the past, and i kept having to go to a hospital and see my mother decline, throw tantrums when she would ask me to bring or buy certain thing for her, and then change her mind, all the while biting my tongue because I didn't want to lose my temper in a ward full of frail old ladies coughing blood and even though I had really really thought i hated my mother at this point, I still loved her and hated to see her suffer so much. My mental health had already been dangling by a thread for quite some time. Eventually we got another call from the hospital, and my mother passed that evening from multiple organ failure. I remember staring at the heart monitor, praying with every fibre of my being for it to keep going, holding my mother's hand... until the nurse said her heart had stopped and the machine was switched off. I said goodbye to my mom, and felt deep anguish: she was never going to meet her grandchildren, something she deeply wanted: for all her flaws as a mother she loved children and it would have been so healing to see her as a devoted grandmother. I smoked a cigarette outside and spent the next few days crying my heart out.
Things got even worse. My mother had not made a will, and since the area we lived in, the area that had been full of stabbings all my life was now a very gentrified area, the house was now worth a lot of money: which meant an insane amount of inheritance tax. My mother was a very bad hoarder as well, so the past year and a half has been struggling to clear out her things and make the huge inheritance tax bill, the first of which came six months after her death. I eventually had to move out of my place and back into the family home due to the inheritance tax taking all my savings and inheritance.
And now? I guess I've reached my breaking point. I'm 28, still have man boobs, have no money, haven't had a boyfriend in eight years, coming up to nine, have never had a job, just volunteer work, and have missed out on so much of life. When I clear out mom's stuff and take it to the charity shop, the loss hits me: so many things are mixed up in there, and it reminds me of times when I was either happy or hopeful for the future, and it feels so bitter that i can't go back to those times. All that's left of my parents are two urns sitting side by side containing their ashes. My sister lives overseas so I have no family left in the country. I just want to redo my life and not be autistic, or gay, or have man boobs, or have had so many mental and physical health problems. Or have had more family around me growing up: people who could have gotten me away from my mother and taught me to be an adult, so I wouldn't have been so emotionally stunted and isolated for most of my life: helped me get into shape, helped me grow up, so i could have had a social life in my teens and twenties, maybe even gotten to the point where i could have had a nice boyfriend or two, instead of years of sexual and romantic frustration.
I see my friends still, but sometimes it's painful because it reminds me of how different my life has been from theirs: they had families, are in relationships are in careers and have had financial stability growing up. Some of them are going on holiday and backpacking through exciting places: yet me I am absolutely broke from having to pay a huge tax bill every year. I don't know... I keep slipping into these daydreams were I didn't have so much shit happen to me: where I am not autistic, where I didn't have such an unstable upbringing, where I met a nice boyfriend and didn't have these two things on my chest that absolutely ruined my confidence that wouldn't shift no matter how much exercise I did... a guy who I could go on dates with, play games with, snuggle up to at night and have a satisfying sex life with, someone who would take me home to meet his family. I wish my parents were still alive and had been a bit more normal. I wish I wasn't born with so many things wrong with my body and mind, that came together to make me far more isolated and sad then I could bear. I wish I had had a big family around me growing up. I just wish I had had a bit more.... stability and normality, then all this chaos.
I don't know. i am on the waiting list for grief therapy and i see a counsellor, but I feel so deeply sad about how much of life I have missed out on, and am still missing out on due to being held back by such a crippling amount of debt. I want to kill myself, but I know I couldn't do that to my loved ones.
I don't know why I wrote this. Venting I guess. I keep wishing i could redo my life. I wish some pieces had come together better. Like if I had to be autistic, I didn't have to be gay as well. If I had to lose my dad, I didn't have to lose my mom as well. That my mom hadn't had so many things wrong with her, because she wasn't a bad person, just very damaged physically and mentally. That my family in America had been around so they could have given me a bit more of a balanced upbringing: that my uncle and aunts had been around to get my mom to back off a bit, that my cousins had been the big brothers I needed to be a man: teach me to shave, take me out, helped me work out, how to socialise, that I had my baby cousins to look after, read stories too, play games with because I always wanted to be a big brother too, and was often sad that I didn't have babies and kids to look after (I have two godchildren which has been wonderful but it does make me wistful that I never had any younger siblings growing up). That I had known that man boobs could have been fixed with surgery so I knew what it was like to take my shirt off at the beach. I wish I could have more experience with dating instead of hooking up with older men as no one my age gave me the time of day. I wish I had a nice boyfriend. I wish I hadn't had a hormone imbalance that made me loathe my body and made me bundle myself up in clothes to hide it and never take my shirt off.
I feel selfish for wanting to turn back time, as the world doesn't revolve around my happiness, I just wish there had been a bit more balance? I didn't expect a happy life handed to me on a platter, I just wish.... so many burdens hadn't been given to me that prevented me from having the life I wanted.... I just wish I could redo my teens and twenties without some of them so things were a bit more bearable and happy and less of a lonely, isolating struggle. There's a lot more I haven't mentioned but I just wish I could wake up and have it be a long time ago, before so many things got worse and worse. I know it's very self indulgent because some people have it so much worse, but I just hate myself and I hate being me. I just wish things hadn't been such a struggle and I wasn't going through losing my mom and having a colossal financial crisis on top of everything else. I guess losing my mom has opened up a lot of old wounds: it's made me feel wistful for past times, and deeply miss my dad and grandma, and wish I could have had things be a bit more normal: to be a bit more like my peers, and be in a bitter place to cope with this loss now.
I wish it was years ago. Making my grandma a cup of tea and sitting in the garden with her. Or playing Ocarina of Time for the first time. That magical moment when a boy kissed me for the first time. Time passes. It feel so strange there was a time when I was a child. Or a young teen. Or a twenty year old, and I actually had hope that things would get better instead of so much worse. It feels sad that I feel nostalgic for those fleeting moments of happiness in a life I've found often so very sad and unbearably lonely. I feel like wanting to hit the reset button makes me a bad person: it's impossible and selfish like the whole world revolves around my happiness. I can't help it though: if I could make those daydreams of being young and in love, and having my family be more normal and alive around, and getting to be more social as a teen and twenty something happen, I would.
I know it's a lot of whine here, but I guess I just wanted to get things off my chest. I know I have to a accept the past and that it's gone and it's written, but I just wish things had been less awful. I keep thinking: if this was how my life was going to be, why was I born? I didn't ask to be an orphaned gay autistic man child with tits from a poverty stricken, unstable background that's never been in love and has been so very very lonely for almost my entire life. Sometimes I wish I'd never been born or I'd killed myself years ago. Thank you for reading.",1

"I started college one week after my 16th birthday. I got a huge academic scholarship to go to a nice private university and everyone was so proud of me. I got used to everyone boosting my ego and calling me a ""genius"". Everything started going downhill when I started dabbling in the drugs, drinking, and partying. I was such a smart kid but the pressure to keep being the person when I started struggling a lot in school because I wanted to be friends with all the wrong people through my newfound freedom in college. I never really found that balance in college between friends and academics. It was either one or the other. When I was 18, I racked up thousands in credit card debit that I can never escape but it was okay because I kept up that facade of a care free lifestyle. Growing up dirt poor and abused for all of my life until I left for college, this was the life I thought I deserved for all of my handwork. Wrong. I should've kept trying harder but my parents never taught me how to be a ""good"" person. I can't blame them entirely though because I know now what is right and what is wrong but I choose the wrong path every time. At 19, I didn't do so well on my grad school entrance exam so I had to retake and take a year off. Well this wasn't really an option for me because I would always take massive student loans out to be able to live in nice apartments and not have to actually have a job. I didn't think I could get a job with my major either... this was where things really fell apart. My parents pressured me into staying in school for another year and take out those loans because they made me believe I wouldn't last in the real world without financial aid.. turns out they were stealing money from me for 4 years through my financial aid account and were trying to keep the cash flow going. During this year, I was so ashamed to tell my friends that I hadn't gotten a degree so I lied. I lied to everyone all the time that I got my degree. Then the lies got bigger because that wasn't enough to appear normal. I became a babysitter while taking online classes (didn't want to run into anyone on campus) but I lied all over social media and in person that I had this kickass lifestyle and job. I feel horrible that I did all of that but I just wanted to be fit in like all of my young professional friends. I couldn't because I had the maturity of a 20 year old.At 20, things started looking up. I got into grad school with a great scholarship! I was so happy. My parents were finally proud of me again. Everything felt great again because I had buckled down and tried so hard to get into the 75th percentile of my entrance exam. Then things started getting bad again. During the summer, I was taking 3 classes that I needed to pass in order to get my degree and start grad school FINALLY. I could've graduated a year ago but I kept going to school for financial aid. This was the worst decision of my life. I had signed my lease already in a different city, had a roommate, borrowed $3,000 for various expenses (thought I was going to be reimbursed with my scholarship), and I event went to orientation. I don't know what happened. I don't know what I did to become so stupid but I failed one of the required classes by .02%. I needed a 60% to pass and I got a 59.8%. I pleaded with the professor and then appealed to the dean. I got a cold, callous response. How could I miss the final exam because I thought it was optional? I had read the syllabus over and over. I had sat in class. Why couldn't I focus and comprehend. What happened to me? Why did the words get jumbled up when I read them and I couldn't understand... this has never happened to me before. The professor and the dean thought I was incompetent. Which I am. I explained everything to them about my situation and what failing the class would mean. My professor told me, ""your destiny is in your hands, not mine"". I fucked up my destiny. I couldn't tell anyone about this, not even the people closest to me in my life because I had already spun everyone this web of lies. Luckily the grad school let me defer for a year because during the year that I spent leaching off of financial aid and after I got into grad school, I started failing my classes because I didn't think they mattered. My gpa dropped by .45. I couldn't get into the school again if I had to reapply.. stupid, right? I made stupid decisions and I became stupid.Where am I today? Well it's supposed to be my first month of grad school in a new city surrounded by passion for the field I love and intelligent, wonderful people. But instead, I am sharing a one bedroom apartment with my older brother who supports me in every aspect of life. I love and appreciate him so much because he's the one person I can be honest with because I know he'll love me anyways. I can't get a good job because I don't have a degree. I don't really know what I'm going to be doing for this next year but I barely ever leave the apartment or do anything that's not watching tv and getting high. I'm lost.My breaking point of how much everything sucks is that this man harassed and berated me in the parking garage for ""almost hitting him"" while on my way up. He followed me all the way up to my assigned parking spot, waited for me to get out of the car with my groceries, and started screaming at me when I did. I calmly apologized but he wouldn't stop. I have been so hurt since that happened last week because I already have horrible self-esteem and negative interactions like that just destroy me. He just wouldn't leave me alone and I didn't understand why my kindness didn't fix things...
Yesterday, I got a package and attempted to pick it up from the leasing office. They said I couldn't because it had my brother's name on it. Weird because I know it was mine. My brother came down this morning and they said I couldn't get any mail delivered here because my name wasn't on the lease and further went on to say that I almost hit someone in the parking garage. So they lied to me yesterday. I can't even stand up for myself. My name can't be on the lease because my parents fucked up my renter's history and I have terrible credit. I feel trapped in a one bedroom box. Another reason not to leave my house anymore. I can't do anything right. I can't even live like a hermit right.I don't know how I'm going to finish this year off. I just feel so broken. I used to be this beautiful, successful, witty, and full of life girl. But underneath all of that, is just the person I am today. A leech, a liar, a worthless filler of space. I thought I could change my life and make some difference but I can't escape my destiny. I try to be nice to people and I get walked all over. All my friends are moving on and here I am digging myself into a deeper hole.",0

"I swore to myself. That i would be famous. That I'll be an actor and a director. I swore I'll do everything it takes no matter how difficult it gets. I always wanted to be everything.

I swore I'll do everything and do my best of the best to get known for my skills. I swore i'll do so good, I'll be employed by the company right after internship.Now, I am on internship. At quite literally the biggest media company in my state. I didn't apply for the position. In fact, I didn't apply for any. I didn't care where I went. I don't see the point anymore. I made a horrible first impression to them. By coming to the interview late, and my first day late. I Guess one of my lecturers who had me when I was in my prime referred me to them. Of course way back when I was offered several scholarships. One of the honour student in the deans list.I'm quiet now. I don't mingle or talk to people. I don't follow them for lunch. I don't anything. I'm either in the studio or outside filling my lungs with cancer. The first week itself the Vice President of the department I was under, asked me to do a side project. He talked to me as if he was a client and I had to produce something. He gave this job to me because he'd seen my portfolio. I was good. I was good before things went to hell.I couldn't do it. I said yes I'll take the job but.. I've lost every grain of creativity in my head to make that happen. I mean I was never that Creative but at least I was something. I'm horrible at what I'm doing here. I know they think I'm all talk. Or I had a lot of help on my portfolio. Isn't true but, they're not wrong for seeing me as an incompetent intern. I was in the washroom one day and I thought about it. I remember swearing that I'll do so fucking good here. I had flair at the point of time. I was popular. Everybody knew me. It was easy talking to people. But now, everything has changed.Whenever they asked me what I wanted to do after internship, nothing pops into my head. I lie and say something to at least give them something. Last night. Last night I asked myself. Where do I want to go? What's out there for me? And I realised. There's really nothing.I realised that there's really nothing holding me back here on earth. Nothing. Nothing I can't let go of. I have no friends. I live away from my family. I have honestly really nothing. My Best Friend? The one I was always there for when he really really felt like shit? He's MIA. I think he thinks I've had it all settled.

I've been making alternative/electronic music since the age of 15 and right now I'm working towards having my debut studio album released. It's not happening anytime soon though. My dad and I are trying to build a studio at his house, but due to how much he works, and how much it costs to redo an entire room from the bone, all I can do is continue to write material for it and expand on arranging the songs. Anyways, back to my issue.  I'm not depressed, I don't think anyways. I'm not sad, nothing is bothering me, nobody is abusing me. I simply think about suicide a lot, and not on purpose. I don't know if it's a subconscious thing and I'm soaking up toxicity from something or if I'm just interested in death. I tend to make jokes a lot. Not jokes about suicide but jokes about me, personally, myself, committing suicide. For example just recently at work my coworker was flipping a coin, and he accidentally let it go to the ground and before he could check it I quickly said ""If it's heads I go to the break room and kill myself!"" and he shot me a shocked/concerned look. I wonder why... But anyways as soon as I said that even I was like wow did I really just say that? 4 times now I've received either the suicide prevention lifeline number from my friends or simply them reaching out and offering support if I need it.I'm kind of concerned that this is only going to get worse, and during yet another time I'm staring at my bottle or aspirin or the bottle of bleach I have on my windowsill above my bed, thinking about how ""I could do it right now if I wanted to."" that I really am just going to do it, and like the jokes I make, be surprised that I did it and regret it (Assuming its something that's not instant). I am a huge mess, but I know I have the capability to become a much better person. Would it be worth it if I did though? Would a haircut, a shave, a shower, a new set of clothes, a new attitude and a new work ethic have any impact on this at all? I don't know I'm just rambling now so I'm gonna stop here. What do I do? I feel as if there's some kind of demon or other thing that's controlling my mind. I don't WANT to kill myself but I'm talking, thinking, and acting like I do and I don't know why. - I'm not depressed, stressed, or angered by anything yet I think about suicide in general quite often. I don't know why I do, and I'm concerned for my own being.",1

"I think I've been ready to die for a very, very long time. I can remember a time, back when I was 12 years old, and I was watching ""The 4400"" with my mom and older brother. There was this episode (I'm sorry I can't be more specific, it was a decade back) where people had created a shot' that could be given to normals'  and they had exactly a 50/50 shot if either getting superpowers, or dropping dead. Both my mother and brother debated while the credits rolled, each determining that, even for the chance at getting some amazing powers, they wouldn't want to risk losing their lives. I said something along the lines of But it's a win wither way! You can either join the 4400, or you don't have to live anymore.  . . . I still remember the looks on their faces. I think it was the first time I started to think of myself as a freak.I'm 23 years old. And I fucking hate myself. I think all people are inherently valuable from that which they bring into the world and people around them. How does one measure a person? By their impact. And for as long as I can remember, i have found myself lacking. I am truly ugly, a round face and dank hair and a potato of a body that trips and stumbles and brushes into other people without their consent or desire. I'm weak, emotionally and physically  couldn't fight to save my life, and wouldn't have the strength of mind to do it anyhow. I'm manipulative  so many people look at me and think that I am a good, sweet thing that only smiles and offers lame jokes and loves life, when in fact I detest living with every particle of my being, and am able to fool everyone I know just by acting like anything matters to me, when I am in fact growing more and more certain that nothin, nothing, NOTHING does at all. I've always unerringly thought myself a fine actress  and the fact that no one around me known enough of my turmoil to think that my jokes about can't wait to die' might just be real really proves it. I'm stupid, and in a field where I will never bring discernible contribution to the world around me, other than serving people who, like myself, don't give a shit about me. I'm sick and twisted and lost in memories and half-fucking-crazy; I am a liar and a thief and some diet-form of a sociopath. I'm Grayson, and I hate myself. For a long time, I was able to convince myself that maybe, just maybe, killing myself wouldn't be the best idea. I tried telling myself all of the usual things; my job will need me, my family will be devastated, my friends will miss me, there are so many things to look forward to, it gets better . . . white noise in my ears, anymore. My job doesn't need me. I love what I do, and once imagined myself doing it forever . . . But let's face it, it doesn't take a genius to check people into a hotel, or manage budgets, or plan parties. I see coworkers getting promoted all around me, with less experience and less time in the industry and less (or no) education, and it just reinforces to me, over and over and over again, that I''m not really hot shit at my job; I'm not going to do anything amazing, or make waves . . . I'll just be in my entry-level position for another three years, working my ass off and still just not being good enough  because desire and ambition don't make it in this world  connections and talent do. Neither of which I have. I am at the point where I have managed to convince myself that my family would understand why I did whatever it is I am going to do; my father was once suicidal, and he survived by the skin of his teeth . . . and made a change for the better in his life. And then he had my siblings, and spawned me into this world. I was never a very good daughter, the kind that my mother wanted and needed . . . but my little sister is there to help her through any loss she might feel in my death . . . And god, my little sister; she's perfect, beautiful and smart and kind and funny and hard-working . . . She's going places, and we all take pride in her every move; I like to think that she would be understanding about what happened, maybe a little sad, but knowing that I am worth more to a world I am not in than one I am consistently fucking up. My older brother doesn't even know me anymore, hasn't been interested in me for a long, long time. My little brother . . . well, we love eachother, but he's a very sensible person, logical almost to a fault; he can understand that there is no point in living if you're not going to do anything worthwhile with the gift you've been given. Truthfully, I think that the only ones I have any doubts about are my niece and nephew  I love the hell out of them; but they are so very young, sweet and impressionable and innocent . . . When I'm gone, it'll only take a few years before they forget Auntie Grayson, and it will be better that way. Life is always better without me. I have three best friends in the world. One of them uses me, clearly and obviously, because I gratify her need for attention. I'd be of better use to her dead, because then she can revel in being the mourning friend of that dead girl. My second best friend is a strong woman, married and independent and tough as nails; she was fine before I came into her life, and she'll be fine long after I'm gone. My last best friend, my oldest and most important . . . Well, about a year ago, she booted me our of her life, and told me she was better with me gone  and really, she was . . . the minute I was gone, she found a better job, managed to get engaged, and bought a house. We're friends again, now, had a weepy reunion and all that bullshit, but there's a hollowness there that was never acknowledged before. I mean, she clearly excelled when I was driven from her life; me ducking out now can only help her further. I am a bad person. I am toxic and shallow and wrong. I wish, sometimes, that someone would come and just beat the shit out of me so I could feel as if, maybe, just a little bit, I am making headway on the punishment I need . . . but I've been (un)lucky enough to avoid anything akin to that.I've started to realize that life doesn't get better. I am 23 years old, have a good job and a boyfriend of more than a year that I love, I am almost done with schooling . . . And I feel nothing. I Google is it okay to want to die and why is my presence a blight upon this world. I drink sometimes, and it helps me sleep; I take burning hot showers because the tingles on my skin make me feel like someone is toughing me, like maybe I am being held, and sub sequentially held back . . . But nothing. I keep trying to rationalize my existence, I believe that everything happens for a reason . . . And I have done SOME good in my life, a drop in the bucket . . . but there's really nothing more I can contribute to anyone, and I feel like my death is the next step. What is the point in hanging around if my purpose has been fulfilled? And, more to the point, my life ending would benefit the people I care about a good great deal; my family and friends would receive the benefit of my years of savings and frugality, my brother would have a completely paid-for apartment for another year, and all of my clothes and things could go to people who would actually appreciate them, to people who need them and want them and care. Some people, I think, just aren't meant to be alive. Some of us are mistakes  and we need to correct mistakes. I think I've made up my mind to kill myself. It is not because I've had a bad life, or because anyone pushed me into it. For once, this is something I'm doing all on my own, and for once, it is something good. I feel so at peace, knowing that I finally made a choice. I don't know when or how (though I imagine soon, and I hope with a gun). I've had a living will and a life insurance policy for some time, and all I really need to do is decide whether or not to leave a note. I don't think I will. I don't want people to remember me. I'm not sharing this to get advice or people telling me not to do it. I just wanted to be honest, just this one time, and tell someone what I am really thinking, what I am really feeling. And God, do I feel light. . . .Thank you for your time. Better luck next time. ",0
I think I've come to terms that my life will always be miserable,1
I think now's my time,1
I think when I first started having suicidal thoughts it was more of a comfort than a plan. Like if things ever got worse there was always a way out. Lately it feels a lot more real. I can't imagine a life where I don't end up killing myself anymore. Everything feels pointless. I'm not getting better. I don't even know what I'm trying to say.,0
"I think you should tell people how you feel, I think suicide is a permanent option that most of the time results out of a temporary issue. You're going to die, that's true and I'm in no position to judge how that happens but to do it by your own hand is taking fate and whatever else we take for granted away, you're consciously taking away tomorrow and tomorrow all your problems could just go away.You also write about ""saying goodbye"" which makes me believe you obviously have people that care about you and in turn, you must care about them. Do you really never want to see your friends, family, or whoever again? Do you really not want them to witness your success and your future? Do not be irrational about this, death is the thing you have to be most rational about. It's cliche but the evidence tells us you only live briefly in this tiny gap of life between two infinite voids of darkness. This could be it, buddy, and you're going to end it early?!
If you truly believe this and think this way and you're utterly convinced and you think it is the only possible solution (bearing in mind people with terminal illnesses and life sentences often decide again it) then you've got to at least talk to someone; someone you care about, about what you're going through and why. It's only fair to the ones you love.Personally, I'd say life is a lot more profitable than death because you're here and it's now. Death will come, just wait, that's all you have to do from damning the ones you love to a lifetime of sadness and regret. It's also good for you because meditating on this fact means you'll realise that you're not tied down to anything, problems are only ephemeral you can tackle them.I hope you talk to someone. Death doesn't hold an answer, it is only an inevitability.",1
I think.,0
I thought a lot about it and I had very suicidal phases. I'm now at the state again that I am sure Suicide is an option for me. By experience it will get worse in some days and after that I'll be worse than ever before. Since I don't know how I can be worse and still survive I'll be ending it this time. It may sound rational but it is meant as I said it.,1

"I thought I did phenomenally on an exam last week. The material was simple. I had it all laid out. It was only like ten multiple choice with about 15 fill in the blank questions. I got close to an F even though on exam day I walked out in full utter confidence that I got nothing less than a B+.Now I got a D on my lab report. I did everything necessary except forgot to do one easy calculation. I lost 6 points and that one calculation could not have been worth that much. It was basic addition and dividing!! An average! This was not the purpose of the lab either. My professors haven't responded to my emails. I want to give up. I want to get my degree and leave my future behind. Another wasted semester.I am feeling very suicidal and hurt. I take responsibility for my faults but I'm in shock that I had this many.I have an exam tomorrow. Another on Friday for a class I don't understand. I'm sure. If I drop it all then I will let my work, fam, coworkers and my SO down.",1

"I thought i had gotten better at coping with body image issues and general lack of confidence by starting to understand reasons why im like this. However i seem to be more sad frequently, trust issues and anxiety have been going through the roof and cry almost on a daily basis.
I'm scared I'm gunna push away this guy i have been recently dating (who has so far been wonderful and supportive) and i can't comprehend why he is interested in me, how he can bare to look at me and i almost expect him to cheat on me/leave me for another girl coz why would you be with me when you could be with someone else?
I'm so tired of feeling like this, I'm so easily triggered now and I really don't know how much longer I can take this. I hate being so bothered by such superficial things, i feel totally useless as a human and wish i wasn't like this. I just want to be happy and pleasant to be around but i don't know how and i feel like my friends don't get how seeing a photo of myself or my reflection makes me feel like i deserve to be killed. If anyone can relate.. i would appreciate someone willing to listen or talk to or help in some way.

"I tied the belt around my neck and the top of my dresser, I wanted to know if I could go through with it. I'm too tall to fully hang so I relaxed my body and closed my eyes. Within a couple of seconds my arms and legs were tingling and I started to fade out. My brains natural reaction was to stand up and save myself. After some googling I found out that if I had waited just a couple more seconds to go unconscious I would've died within 20 minutes.
No one would know, I live alone in an off campus university apartment. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and said she just didnt want to be in a relationship right now and that down the road we could try again. I know she's lying. I'm overwhelmed with University things and I can barely take care of myself at my apartment. I wish I would've gone through with killing myself. It's the only solution I have to all my problems. ",1

And i got a dyagnosis: Avoidant personality disorder. I hate the ""survivor"" and the ""now begin a new life"" stuff, but that dyagnosis is actually helpful. Years of therapy and i needed to almost bleed to death for someone to tell me what the fuck is wrong with me. They never mentioned that im very ugly but thats ok. I already knew that it makes socializing even harder.Next time i will follow the main plan and just jump from my rooftop. I dont know why i thought at the last moment that cutting my wrists would be a decent substitute. Well, i know why: there was a lot of people calling the police when they saw me sitting on the edge of the void about to do it. Anyway, i should have done it. And... suiciding and then waking up is a feeling beyond any descriptio, so i dont think i want to experience that again. I think it affected me in ways i dont want and will not understand....They took my phone during those days, im sorry if i worried someone here. I feel so lonely. Its completely overwhelming. But i really felt some human feeling like ""someone cares about me"" or something like that when i loged in today and discovered so many private messages still asking if i was ok. Thank you all.

everyone has left me. all my friends, including my best friend of five years. without any warning. just stopped talking to me. my boyfriend left me. said it was all my fault and that he didn't care about me and that i was nothing to him.

on monday, i was at therapy when my therapist laughed at me while i was telling my feelings. the same day someone was threatening me with blackmail and said he'll ruin my life if i don't let him rape me. and when i tried to reach out to multiple people they all gave some response on the lines of ""i don't care.""

All I do is drag her down. Shes become so depressed lately because she can't save me/fix me/cure me.I'm tired of this limbo. I'm so tired. Every moment I am awake, every breath hurts physically because of my sickness. There is no cure, no one cares to find one, and I'm not even able to manage the ""severe chronic pain"" side effect without getting treated like shit (but there's no way to explain that you're suicidal because you can't get pain medication without sounding like a drug addict, even with multiple chronic pain-causing diagnosiss, diagnosi, whatever).Make it stop.

i used to have someone in my life who would cry just because they saw me crying and i miss that so much ha. now i just cry alone in the dark and it makes me cry even more. i just want somebody to care about me that much again but no one does and sometimes i feel like no one ever will again but maybe that'd be for the best i mean at least nobody would have to waste their time with a paranoid idiot like me.

As they began to accept that they were going to die, they would slowly let go of things that had once been important to them.  Despite still trying for quite some time, this has been slowly happening with me for the past year.  I don't think I really realized it until today when I felt an utter disconnect to the second most important thing in the world to me.  Now I just have one last thing to let go of.  Not trying to get people to panic and attempt to ""save me.""  As if they could... Just feels good to be real somewhere.  To share what's going on.

I can't go a day without thinking about how purposeless I am. I don't know what's keeping me here. I have no real reason to be here.
I've had very little life experience, I guess, I won't make it in the real world. I wasn't ever very social or liked or loved. I know my suicide would hurt a few people, but then again, I'm at the point where I don't really care. It might be selfish to some, but in my opinion I'm doing a favor for myself as well as a few other people. How is doing a favor selfish?I feel like suicide is my last choice but...
I'm terrified of what comes after death. I don't want to fail. I don't want to live after a failed suicide attempt. I've failed suicide attempts before & I'm terrified, but I just want to END it.

"I want to die. A lot. I have been suicidal since I was seven, and have had a few attempts since I was 18. People always tell me ""it gets better"".... but that's such b.s. It hasn't. It won't.
Why isn't it ""okay"" for people to kill themselves? Whether it be from religious groups or ""caring"" people... why is it not okay? If a person is miserable and in pain every day of their life, constantly wanting to die even when they're ""happy"", wouldn't it be cruel to pressure them into staying alive or saving them after they attempt suicide?
Only once did I feel grateful for surviving my most dangerous suicide attempt (drug induced heart attack)... that feeling lasted for two days before I began wishing i was dead again.
""Dying prevents things from getting better""... oh yea? well dying also prevents things from getting worse. I dont' want to risk staying alive for me just to feel worse.
I hate being alive. I hate being here. I Just want to die. I want to kill myself, but I'm scared I'll fuck up again cuz peope will ""save me""... and then my family and I wil have to face the bills of being saved.
I've been on this planet for 25 years, and 18 of it has been me wanting to die. Things wont' get better, I'll never be normal or content or happy without these stupid thoughts in my head.
I've ""seen help"" and I've been pushed away for being too severe of a case. I've been on meds, but then my insurance stopped covering the ones that work for me. I don't care that I have friends or a boyfriend; I'm just going to lose them eventually anyway.",1

"I want to start this by stating that I've been diagnosed with OCD by psychologists but have always refused to take meds. This
tendency towards compulsive thought and regret seems to stem from the many tumultuous and dark times I have been through in my short and inconsequential life. Two days ago, I indulged in self-harm for the first time. I have a girlfriend and she loves me dearly. I know she would be devastated if I were to end my life but these thoughts seem to obscure any enjoyment for life that I used to have. I don't know how long I'll last.I, for the first time in my life, am considering suicide over a reddit post. There's an old reddit post that contains my personal info and shows up when my name is written into Google. I am an extremely anxious person with a proclivity towards obsessive and compulsive thought. The post in question is immature in nature and there's something about my name showing on the internet on such a post that makes my heart sink, thinking I will never get a decent job and everyone will take me for a fool. And if you're wondering under what form my name appears, it appears in a screenshot.I've tried reaching out to admins, twice and they seem to turn a blind eye to the fact that I'm thinking of ending my life over this. They give me the runaround ""Your full name does not constitute personal information."" which I would say it does. I mean what is there that's more personal than your full legal name? Also, where do you draw the line? A human being is telling you he's suffering and thinking of pulling the plug on his life, yet some old, insignifcant post (except for me, because finding it is a matter of typing my name) that's gathering dust somewhere on the backpages of reddit?I've tried reaching out to the guy who made the post, he agreed to help me and deleted his account shortly thereafter before I was able to provide him with the link that's been plaguing my mind for the past 2 months (I'm assuming he thought deleting his account would translate into all his old posts being deleted). I've tried everything that came to mind, left no stone unturned and have not succeeded in finding a good Samaritan that would help alleviate my pain. My life is in a dark place to begin with and this is starting to feel like the straw that will break the camel's back. Can anyone help me or advise me on what to do?

I feel like I'm a horrible person and incredibly difficult to develop an intimate friendship with--maybe because I crave them so bad.

Now all I want to do is make him feel the same way that he wanted his ex to feel when he tried to kill himself.

Why should I even try to be close to people? Some friends say it's a beautiful thing, but does it matter if it's beautiful if it keeps causing me pain? I just miss this guy so much. I don't have many close friends, and I feel so lonely. I told him I was feeling unsafe and that he needed to call me and stay on the phone with me until my friend came. He said he felt terrified and manipulated. I apologized and backed off, and luckily my friend showed up. I can't believe I tried to use my own suicide to get him to talk to me--it just makes me feel like I'm even more of a bad person.I can see why he hates me. He says I'm a good person, but he hates me.

"I was in intensive care for 3 weeks, unconscious but I was told later I couldn't breathe by myself and I had to have dialysis while I was in there. When I came round I was in the renal high dependency unit because my kidneys had failed, so I had to have dialysis a lot. I relapsed on that ward where my lungs began to fill up with fluid and I almost died again. Luckily I recovered but still needed dialysis. Eventually after a month I started to become stable and was allowed home, I still have to go to hospital for monitoring and from that I also have blood clots on my lungs and I'm anemic. It's been two months now since I've been home and I'm still very weak, I can't walk far without being exhausted so I don't leave my house yet. I'm pretty much constantly sick and have trouble holding food down, which makes managing the anemia difficult. I can't take my mental health medication now because of my kidneys so I'm mentally worse off now than I was before I went in. I can't sleep for more than 2-3 hours at a time even though I'm constantly exhausted, this leaves me with massive headaches. When I do sleep I have nightmares. I also itch a lot I'm not sure if it's the anemia or kidney damage so I'm going to a check up this week to find out. I have nasty scars on my neck from the dialysis which probably wont go. ",1

I guess I couldn't wait that much, would've been a very slow death. This just happened. I don't know what to do or think right now.

"I was just diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum in July and I'm 24 years old. I grew up with an abusive and neglectful mother. Now I live with my father and he is wonderful. However, I can count on one hand the number of people who care about me. (Hint: it's 2) I can't find any help because for 1, apparently no one knows wtf autism is for some reason, even in mental health facilities, 2, it is assumed I should have gotten this help long ago. That part is true, but not my fault. While applying for medicaid disability, I was told that because I didn't have any accommodations as a child, I would most likely be denied. I was so stressed and upset all throughout high school that I took an hour out of class every day to cry in the restroom. That teacher didn't know what was up with me, but he had a heart. I was physically ill all the time from stress and remember breaking down in front of students and teachers in class claiming that I didn't understand how I could finish the work in time and why no one else struggled. I was always told it would be worth it to graduate. Six years later and the misery I endured there was most certainly not worth it. Nothing in my life has been worth it.

"I was just so desolate and miserable last night. I continuously drank straight Kraken on a whim until I couldn't stay up just hoping I wouldn't see today. I'm going through a lot of shit. Shit that's been plaguing me most of my adult life. The people that raised me are all dead or moved away. Friendships are fleeting and a relationship is impossible. The love of my life doesn't love me back and no one else compares. I've been severely depressed for nearly 20 years and I have no motivation to help myself. I started self-harming recently and that helps my mind some but doesn't do my body any favors.I had a bad day Thursday and when I have a bad day, it takes me about a week to get over it. It gets worse before it gets better and like a wound, the danger ends up being the infection over the wound itself. I remember waking up on my keyboard and at some point I moved to the living room while waiting for a text from the girl mentioned before and didn't wake up until morning. I don't drink a lot normally so that without any food made my tolerance pretty low. I'm not really sure why I'm putting this here. I don't expect help nor do I want advice. I had a stupid moment and just wanted to share I guess. It's easy for me to accept death these days because I look at it like, I could die now or I could die later. The only difference is age.

I was molested from age 5-6/7 I can't remember well. This year has been hell. I cannot cope I think I must go. To protect everyone I love and hold dear to me. For the better. I've been getting nightmeres and horrible thoughts about hurting my brother who is everything to me. I'm so scared all the time. I'm scared I will become like the man who used me as a child. People say that the abused go on to abuse I think I'm turning into a monster and I can't stop it. The more I fight the thoughts the stronger they come the more elaborate they become but if I don't fight them I feel dirt and horrible. I feel like a monster and I want to kill myself for it. I get nightmares that he comes back and abused all my friends and he forces me into a monster who has to do whatever he wants. I don't want to hurt anyone and I never have. But these thoughts. They will not stop . I always worry that i'm turning into a pedo I'm always scared. I'm always scared that maybe I hurt my brother or someone in the past but don't remember. I've been to the GP 4 times with no help nothing. I told my Dad 3-4 times about the molestation when I was small only to have him ignore me and tell me to forget about it.I told my mum and she just gave me anointed oil and tells me to put it on my head. It's like this is a joke. It's not a joke at all. Why can nobody see that? This is terrifying and I don't know what to do. I've asked for help many times and I've always been ignored. Maybe it's because I'm a girl if a male came with these thoughts they would put him in a mental hospital asap. But because I'm a short innocent looking girl soft spoken I'm a joke. I have nowhere to turn. What should I do I really think killing myself is the best. I protect my brother from my thoughts and I stop suffering in this way. I've exhausted all other options. I've tried I really have but to no avail. This has made me loose my faith in god I prayed all the time but I saw myself slipping away whilst I felt like talking to a brick wall. What farther would let his child suffer like this after begging for help . All I do is cry and sleep. I can't concentrate I push my brother away because i'm so scared I can't even sit without worrying.,1

"I will never be loved. My moment has come and past. I'm 27, spanish, ugly and virgin, and i never had a friend or a gf. My parents are disgusting people. School was hell, i was shy, everybody ignored me completely and two teachers bullied me for years. During my 5 years of college i tried to stop the isolation and did It ALL: therapy (2 kinds of It), forced socializing during classes, asking everyone how to be normal and make friends, i did meditation (during 4 years!) and yoga, i went to every open parties, smiling and talking to litteraly everyone that i could, i used social media everyday and asked out dozens of females during all those years (and get rejected EVERY single time). I enhanced my english so i could talk to foreign students too... I visited teachers during the hours you can do It, and talked about my problems with some of them. I had a diary where EVERY FUCKING DAY I wrote what i had learned that day, what have I done or Who Ive been trying to talk that day and positive stuff like that. I cleaned my room to the point It was like a monk room. I went to swim twice a week, and when i stopped swimming I began to run for an hour every day (alone of course...) I changed my clothes and hair more than 5 times, trying to hide my disgusting looks. I found a easy job during weekends two times, so i could meet  a even more people and i could pay therapy and medication. And yes, I did all these things and more while taking medication for my social anxiety. And during a whole year, i was a volunteer and helped some very old women with basic stuff like eating and going for a walk. I tried It ALL before graduating. And failed miserably. I got NOTHING from all of this. Just remembering It makes me feel sooooo tired (i could barely sleep If i wanted to study and change myself enough to have friends at the same time) I'm a failure, and my time has past now. Now I'm a isolated proffesional philosopher.I should be looking for a job now, but It doesnt worth.  I'm supposed to be a teacher soon, but i know i cant even see a teenager couple without wanting to end It all (i will never experience that) and beautiful Young women only make me feel like I'm done. Why should i get a job, or keep studying anyway? I don't want to be isolated anymore and those things are not going to help at all. Why trying ANYTHING If you KNOW Its not going to work? What should i do with the money if i can keep a job? More therapy? More medication? Expensive meditation? Going to parties? I cant share the money incould earn and i dont want It. Nothing is going to help.  Nobody can help me. My destiny is to be as lonely as a human being can be. Or to kill myself. And thats whats gonna happen. I'm going to jump from my rooftop one day or another, very soon. I smoke for an hour every night there, trying to find the courage to do it... isolation is so much for me now that i ran out of ways to scape It. Now Its just me and loneliness.Now i can barely think or feel anything at all. Im deeply depressed. My good days when i had hope and energy to change myself had past, because i know nothing can help me no matter how hard i try. I'm way too ugly, too beta, too boring and shy. Most of the time i can barely think at all,  i watched like an spectator how extreme isolation destroyed my mind, so right now, that i feel more lucid than usual, i wrote this. Most of the time i feel like a retarded person. One day i will end It all. And i really hope its happens as soon as possible. Because im so coward that i litteraly created this account on reddit so i could find the courage to kill myself.Sorry for bad english. ( I don't think i will be able to explain myself again before killing myself, lucidity is rare for me at this point, thats why i copy-paste this mess again and again, I'm sorry)",1
I will probably kill myself in a week,1
"I wish I could die while sleeping... peacefully. Take me out and finish this waste of life. Suck my soul out of my body and reset my mind. I'm tired of having these thoughts. I'm tired of breathing just to live. I'm tired of taking my own life. Someone end it, please.",0
I wish I could just escape who I am. I'm so dissatisfied with myself. I feel broken. Blah blah getting better is too much work. My brain doesn't work like it's supposed to. Feeling broken at all is too hard to accept. It's too hard to laugh about. It's too hard to joke about. It's too hard to talk about. It's too hard to connect with people. It's too hard to stop feeling anxiety. I'm a whining child who would rather complain about how unfair it is that this is my life than do something about it because that feel impossible. Other people have it way worse than I do. Some people didn't even get to live this long.  What the fuck is my problem?,1

"I wish I didn't have to worry. I want to know everything is going to be ok but it's not. It's not going to be ok because I'm a lazy poor excuse for a human being. I lost my job because I couldn't take my ass to work on time. Since then I've just been staying at home with my parents and it's ok. Everyone told me how I wouldn't be able to handle ""the real world"" when I was slacking off in high school (oh yeah I dropped out by the way) and now I understand. I'm not even ""out in the real world"" yet but now that I've experienced a little bit of it I want out. I want a way out of the real world where I don't have to worry about anything. I just want to . But I can't do that so the only way out is to take myself out. The funny thing is that when I do finally get up the courage to follow through, I'm so scared of death that the best case scenario is for someone to find me and save me so I can buy myself some time where I can just  for a little while longer. I don't know what would happen after that; I haven't gotten that far. Am I just looking for attention? I want a way out but I don't want to face my fears. I'm literally the biggest coward I know.

I feel so bad for her.
I love her, I really do but I never spend time with her. 
I'm looking for a good home for her. She's so fucking beautiful and sweet. I'm a piece of shit for not loving her more. 
The best thing in this play doh life.I just distance myself from everyone and everything.
Everything feels fake.I think something is wrong with my eyes or my head, but everything looks fake too. 
Like I'm looking through lenses in a body that isn't mine. Like a camera out of focus.I honestly wonder if I am real, or anything is real.
If I end my ""life"" I will wake up and be in my real life.
I feel like I am locked in a very long, tiring dream.I had planned my suicide for about three years now. I told the few buddies I had what's going on with me. 
It motivates me to go through with it even more, because now I have something to prove.
They're upset, of course they are.
I felt bad for them, but they're not real either.My ""father"" asked me for the first time in 3 months if I was avoiding him.
I almost laughed in his face. 
He asks me now?I lost weight, a lot of weight. I thought it would help my confidence and make things easier. It doesn't. Don't let anyone fool you.
I'm sure eating well and exercise works for some people, but for me it was just a feeble attempt at changing the inevitable.I started smoking marijuana. The medicinal properties are amazing. Better sleep, it makes me actually eat, not to mention how the rock that sits in my head feels so light. I wouldn't say it made me ""happy"" but it definitely did more for me than any medication, counselling or healthy lifestyle ever has.
Too bad there is so much stigma around marijuana. It's honestly just as bad as mental illness.I honestly wished I had started smoking sooner.I always told myself people who kill themselves are week. 
That, that isn't me. I am strong.
I still think I am strong.

"I work at [fast food joint]. They claim they train everyone everywhere so everyone can be in different spots if need be. They hardly trained me at making food, which I am actually good at and can contribute to the company efficiently. Day 2, they put me on register in front with no training whatsoever. I have no idea what I'm doing for the most part up there, and the constant new people and being the face of the business is not me. I'm not that kind of person. I freak out when I talk to best friends, let alone stranger after stranger. Also I get yelled at constantly by both customers and managers because I still have pretty much no training. once in a blue moon I get to make food and I'm really good at it. I don't mean to toot my own horn, but it's just the facts. The managers always put someone trained for register on assembly or grill and the food line is always out of food, but not when I'm back there. It makes no sense where they place people and I've  talked to them a bunch of times... Some people never leave grill, things would run so much better for their business and for me mentally if they could put me there. They pretended to listen and said they understood my anxiety issues, then after a week right back to register for pretty much ever. I honestly have such fear every morning before work I consider suicide realistically. My life is already a terrible mess without their complete and utter disregard for employees strengths and weaknesses. It's not only counterproductive to their business but it is killing me almost literally. I'm a fish who is paid to climb a tree while they drown a monkey. I'm dying.Please give me advice.

"I... figured out that I need to talk to someone before I kill myself. So... uhm... I 'll post this shit here. I still haven't finnished writing this, so I'll probably post the rest... one day. Who knows. w/eAnd well, I'm here. With you. Or, rather, with no one. And well, I must confess, for those who do not know what this means, it will make no sense. So, just maybe, I should explain a little what I'm talking about.
Yeah, indeed. I should do that. Maybe even you, I mean, whoever you are, are confused about this. Well, maybe, I should start by explaining who is the ""you"" I'm talking to, right? No...? Well, in the end it is my choice so...Well, dear you, you are... yourself. Crazy right? Oh, still does not understand? You are YOURSELF. Look at the mirror, or at the webcam. You are the person who is, by whatever reasons or means, reading this note. So... uhm... maybe I should confess to you why I'm writing this... right? Well, it's always up to you if you're going to read this, or not, so... I hope you stay with me. Just a little longer? Maybe? ............Wait. You're still here? Ha, strange one. Okay, well, that means you do wanna understand why all this. Let's start... by the beginning, maybe?So... uhm... that would start... 23  years ago. Brazil. Yeah, that's when I'm born. Nononono, don't worry, won't take long to tell everything, I'll make it quick. I was born. Mom and Dad happily married wadahwadahwadah...
No, that's not so true. Mom wasn't really happy with dad, dad was kinda on drugs, durign those days. When I was three they broke up. No this is not about being raised without a dad. Well maybe it is, I wouldn't know the difference... 
Well, maybe you can sort that out? Uhm? Oh yeah, sorry. I'll keep going.
So... 2~3 years old, no dad... I didn't miss him during those days though. Not that I remember. Well, time goes on and I'll enter school. Big school, full of peoples and... friends?  Wouldn't call them that, but okay, I guess. Let's just say... most little friends were not very friendly, or w/e. Can't really remember much from those days, can only remember being rejected QQCouple years later, joined elementary school. Not sure how it works where you live, but here we have 9years in elementary school, then 3 in highschool, then college. 
So, uhm... 1st year I kinda learned to read... except I already knew. Kinda. Well, it was kinda fun. 2nd year I... don't really remember. I remember I wasn't very popular, and I remember I, occasionally, would shit myself. Yeah, quite literally. Disgusting, I know. Not very higienic also, true. but, well, that was when everything started to go wrong. Bullying and all that.It followed me untill I went to college. The bullying, no the shitting myself part. That stopped somewhere before 5th year. So uhm... I'll not talk about the bullying part here. I don't want to. Wouldn't feel right, So, expect random cut offs and subjects. Those will be to run from the bullying subject. Okay? 
So... where was I... Oh! Yeah, well, I was kind of smart though, so that's a plus. Kinda, cuz I was way too talkative also, and would run through all the class untill everyone would scold me and yell at me and all that. Well, I... just have always liked to play. And since the subjects were kind of... way too easy (lol). So... I had nothing to focus on. Well... lame excuese, I get it, but still, that was me. So... uhm.. something else happenned at that time. Mommy got a boyfriend. This big, huge, tall, FAAAAAT, boyfriend. Nice guy though. Rude as rock, but nice. I think. Uhm... Well, he had 2 kids. So... I kinda got a brother and a sister. I think that you would call the my brother-in-law and sister-in-law. Well, we do not have a word for that here, so... they were them. We would see each other every weekend, once at my home, once at their home, untill 5thyear of elementary school.
Oh, by the way, lemme tell who I used to live with:
Mom(would work all day. Usually we wouldn't see each other much as she usually would get home late and leave very early in the morning to work. But weekends were great, and she was the most absolutely gorgeous, beautiful woman. Still, when we would fight, she had this anger inside. Against me. As if she hheld some hatred towards me deep inside her. Because I was her exhusband's son. But when we were not fighting, she has always been the best.
Grandma(takes care of her home untill today. Can barely walk without feeling pain in her ankles, but would walk a thousand miles as long as there is some shop with... well, anything from clothes to house decoration. But, mainly, shirts.)
Grandpa(Used to work a lot in an industry(as a guard during the night), and sleep during the afternoon. Later on, he used to take kids to school on his Kombi.(YUP. He had a School Kombi. Certified and everything.) Very funny caring and... but wouldn't want to make him angry.)
And, last, 
Uncle.(Oh... uncle. Might write a whole sotry just about how he made my life hell. Not directly, or willingly. But still, made it hell. Every morning he and grandma would argue about his religion, or about what he wanted to eat, or about his dick size, or about how his chest was... sunken in the middle. Yeah, strange topics. And I would listen to that everyday. Yeeah, every single day. Annoying, but... I ended up getting used to it. A videogame/RPG addicted. Only good thing he gave me.(Besides the fact that once he looked at me and, during an arguemente with my grandma, he said that I didn't need to worry, cuz my dick definitely would have a good size, cuz my dad's dick also had a goold size. I had... like 7 or 8 years old.)Well, these are the people that lived with me. 
So, uhm... I had a few friends at the townhouse. There were... 10 buildings, if I'm not mistaken. So, there were the summer friends, those that would appear only in summer and the year long friends, that would stay throughout the year. There were a few, and and whole lot lot of stories that are quite funny and interesting, but none really important for this. So lemme make the 2nd to 4th years quick.2nd year, I remember absolutely nothing besides shitting myself and everyone laughing at me. That's it. Besides having the best grades of the class, and being talkative as hell to whoever sit besides me, wether they liked it or not though. But, of course, this wasn't nice.3rd year, good teacher, I fell in love with this blond girl that everyone else was in love with, I had no chance, and I felt really bad about that. I still had the best grades. Kinda become the class's clown, to try and make friends. Didn't work at all. Talked to mom about not having friends. She argued with someone at school that wnet to class and kinda ordered other kids to make friends with me. I felt like shit and learned that I should not talk to my mom about this, otherwise I'd be only more embarrasesed about that. At 6 to 7 years old, my problems with friends would have to be my own, and not anyone else's. 4th year, good teacher, I fell in love with this other blond girl that everyone else fell in love  also. I still had no chance, and felt even worse about that. I still had the best grades. Had a rival that year... Good guy, really funny. Not smart at all, he failed completely that year also. BUT, he had a girlfriend. Or something like that. Still had few to no friends. Not the best of the years.5th year, good teachers. Yeah, had 2 that year. One of them would laugh a little at my silly jokes. But still the same thing. Oh, by the way, blod girl #1 was back to my class. Kinda fell in love with her again. But there were other girls that were as hot as her. And still, few to no friends. My grades gradually fell this year. At 8-9 years old, I remember having spent nights crying thinking about killing myself. Also got my first computer this year, and loved the gameboy advance emulator, Gunz:The Duel and played the demo of dungeon siege so many times that I can't really remember.6th year, hard one. Went to live in another city, since my mom decided to live with her boy friend. But she had just joined college, and would stay away most of the day. Well, this time I would actually only see  her at weekends. StepDad wasn't so bad... unless when he had to protect his daughter. Then... everything was my fault x) Either way, hell would describe my experience in this place. Not many friends, I was cocky about my brain, didn't really get good grades cuz wouldn't really focus on school. My brother-in-law left home during winter to live with his mom. My stepdad was unbearable for him.7th year, even tougher. 6 months after his son leaving, stepdad would have his good days and hell days. Mom wouldn't really listen to me, not htat I tried a lot but... still. My grades were kinda better, I was starting to make friends, kinda. Went thourhg a hell lot of situtations that year. Learned a lot, met MSN. Had a fake e-mail and account where I would trick horny grown up lesbians into sending me erotic vids, nudes and showing themselves on webcam. Also used to join UOL's chat and fake myself into someone else. Apparently, I was really good at that, since I got a fair ammount of friends this way. 8th year: bad year. Back to the starting city, the one where I was born. And... back to old school. Everyone had grown bonds, and all that, I came back as a strange. Everything was different, and I felt really out of place. Made a few friends though. I was still playing the duel though, whenever I had internet... almost never. Lost contact with everyone that I had on msn before. Bad thing, cuz I was starting to discover that I could be quite appealing as myself, if I didn't show my face. Kinda made a girl fall in love with me. Just kinda, but was enough to fell a little good about myself... And enough to feel that someday, someone, would love me indeed. By who I am. Not just cuz I was family or w/e.
At this point, I was already alone at home. My bedroom was the only room in my floor, and no one would go there oftenly. Loved the peace, hated the loneliness. My sister would occasionaly go there and make me company. Too bad we weren't very close, I liked her. 9th year My sister(in-law) went away to live with her mom. So... I was completely lonely. 100%. Untill I met people from 1 grade below. Started talking to them, fell in love and... at the end of the year I kissed her. Curious fact: I dated her for 2 weeks before kissing her. She went to live in another city at the end of the year. Oh and there were these girls that were really friendly to me during the year. We kinda became best friends! Good old times. Oh, and in an arts class, someone saw the volume of my dick in through my pants. And I got a big dick kind of fame. hell yeah, that year was feeling good. Could I say it was the best year in my life? HELL YEAH IT WAS. Also, I started to play Wonderland Online. Good game, lots of people from everywhere but Brazil to talk with. That's when I learned english for real. Also, I discovered my dad would live and work besides my school, basically. Got very sad about that. Kinda started somewhat of a friendship with him. 1st year(highschool) Kept dating, through internet my girlfriend from last year. Lasted exactly 1 year, a couple hour less actually. I kinda of cheated on her after she went missing for a long time. I said kinda, cuz it was through sexting. With a girl from somewhere in europe, lithuania maybe. Could be a guy also. Who knows. Either way, got a good ammount of friends in game, didn't need irl friends anymore also. AFter all, all of them were just annyoing at this point. Most of them weren't inteligent enough to keep an interesting conversation, wouldn't know a thing about games, anime, computer or anything like this. They... basically, liked Big Brother and other... erm... nor very interesting programs. Also, TV was their main source of entertainment. I was into computer a lot more. Had a few internet friends. At the end when my girlfriend broke up with me, Kinda felt depressive though. I started playing volleyball somewhere in this year.2nd year Although I was depressive, I learned that... if I wanna feel better, I just need someone to get naked to me. So... I got a web girlfriend from an asian country. She was 10 years old but was deeply in love with me, as I was with her. Or so I thought. We started dating somewhere between 2nd and 3rd year, and we got along very well. Not much to talk about school, I just ignored it, mostly. Oh, by the way, I was playing volleyball this year. And that's the end of it also.3rd year NOW, this was a strange year. I was already kind of fluent at english and I had finnished the englishcourse outside school. School offered extra classes for the admission test for college(if you wanna get in a college here, you have to do this test. And your grades during elementary to highschool means absolutely nothing.) and I took it. Most of the time I ignored it though. Also, I started some dancing classes. Good old things. By the end of the year I had took the tests for the public colleges(considered to be the best in my country) and I was accepted at Mechanical Engineering. Theoretically  that should have been good. Well.... I'll stop here as I'm kinda tired. I'll finnish it later, if I'm still around or in the mood.",0

"Im 29 years I live with my parents house with my son and her mother she is going to graduate in February is when I will commit suicide. I lived with depression for 10 years 5 of them going to psychiatrist and take meds but i stopped because they were not helping and was wasting money, now i am not depressed anymore is that nothing  make me happy cant find joy or anything and im tire of faking around my family.The worst of all is that i dont want to work i just want to do nothing  i just want the quit embrace of death because if i live i have to make money but i dont want my parents keep paying to keep me alive.Edit:Not the day of her graduation after February i already wait 10 years what's a couple of months more",1
"I'll be 22 next month. Dying young and fugly sounds right up my alley!I've been ridiculously depressed/suicidal since I was 9. I remember wishing I'd wake up as a boy, but I hid my thoughts and feelings from everybody. I mainly wanted to be male for life's opportunities. I wanted to join the army, be a mechanical engineer, a construction worker, an auto detailer, work in the oil industry, as a welder, almost every virtually unattainable job for someone like me. I don't want to fight for acceptance and prove myself, as well as probably deal with sexual harassment. I just wanted to be ""one of the guys"". But I can't. Ever.I've been deeply fascinated with the military since I was a kid, as well as cars and guns. My mom says I'm an old soul/been here before. Maybe my soul was thrown into this useless husk by accident? HahahaMy life currently revolves around my Challenger. I've felt rather masculine all my life, and I believe that's why I've never had a proper boyfriend. Maybe it's because I'm black and 5'10 too, who knows. I have mostly guy friends and simply cannot click with most women, tbh I don't really like them. I've tried becoming friends with lots of girls who like cars as much as I do (online groups/forums), and they just blow me off. Car guys respect me and I've made several lasting friendships with them.  Everyone I know describes me as happy, full of life and so nice/kind. If only they knew of my plans to buy that s&w revolver I'd been wanting for over a decade. I'm terrible at math. Even if I wanted to be one of those trailblazers in the STEM/trades fields, I'm literally incapable of doing so. I've tried filling in the gaps on my math skills, but it's just too much to catch up on. I've never set foot in college, because I know it would be a waste of money and time with my shitty skills. I've been working since high school graduation, being the breadwinner for my mom and grandma.My mom uses me as her shoulder to cry on and depend upon. I can't do that with her. She always gets mad and makes it all about herself. She guilt trips me about wanting to try alcohol (she doesn't know that I keep a stash of a variety of mini bottles in my room), but has no problem probing me for cash to buy her cartons of cigs (not cheap...)There's so much more, but I'm tired of trying to sneak type this at work. I'm just not happy. I hate my body and my mind. Just one bullet to the head will end everything. ",1
"I'll be dead, just you wait and see.",1
"I'll first start off by saying that I do have thoughts of suicide but not thoughts of going through it, just ways of starting. With that said, I'm not in a state of mind where I'd follow through with any of the thoughts. I'd understand if this post isn't allowed for that reason. I am feeling worthless however, I'll be 25 in a few days with absolutely nothing to show for it. I've went to college for a year, trucking school for about 6-7 months, have had 2 jobs with 1 being for about 3 weeks and the other being 2 days. Bottom line is I quit everything and now it's left me trapped turning 25 with barely any experience or anything. I also have a school loan from trucking school for 3 grand. That isn't very much compared to other school loans but it sure is when you aren't making anything. The problem is that I have a mild stutter which makes interviews really difficult to get through, especially if I get nervous. For that reason I didn't even apply for a job for about 6 months due to just giving up. A few months back I said fuck all of that and started applying to places. Got a few interviews but nothing turned out. Then I got a job from a temp agency which was the job I quit in two days so now I'm right back where I started! It's just a horrible feeling watching other people from your class in high school starting to graduate college, starting to advance in their careers and such while I have absolutely nothing. I really want to be a meteorologist as I've always been obsessed with that sort of thing but I need a job to be able to pay for gas and such to even go to school. The location I'm in is really crappy for job opportunities as the closest decent sized town is 20-30 minutes away so it's not like I'm in a city with tons of job openings or anything. I don't really know what kind of advice I'm looking for but I feel like getting everything off my chest is a great start.",1

That's how awful it is, and believe me, I'm very appearance and hygiene oriented.Why should I work a job below my intelligence collecting fish or being a garbage woman? Why should I have to live this kind of life? It's not like I can just change the condition. Learning to computer program would require at least 6-7 months of solid study, and during that time, I would have to be housebound like usual because I have no other way of interacting with people without the flies and smell being a major issue.I'm still looking into methods, because gas masks are so expensive and I'm scared of hanging. I don't truly want to die, but I bother so many people just by being around them, that I honestly see no other solution. I'll never have a normal social life or family life! I'll never be in the field I want to be in! The one positive point about me dying in a few weeks is that I'm leaving what I do have to charity, which is very important to me. Furthermore, my Mom has repeatedly encouraged me to kill myself for not going to medical school (she doesn't understand I have TMAU because she's a genetic carrier and cannot smell me the way others smell me), so I don't think she'll be that bothered about me dying.

"I'll say it now, before you thinking I'm a woman, I'm not, I'm a straight male and I despise other men. Why?Men ruined my fucking life, that's why. I hate every last fucking one of them, know what men are? They're animals, fucking animals, violent, selfish, aggressive animals. Men are about one stone throw away from chimps. They created a fucked up society where literally sociopath is rewarded above all else and kindness and altruism is weakness.Men have bullied me my entire life. Why? Because I don't fit in with what they're supposed to be. Because I'm not aggressive. Because I have a gentle nature. Because I'm passive.Women may not like me, that's true, but men made sure they don't, by making it impossible for me to like myself. Being insulted as a kid, being told my whole life either that I'm not good enough or I'm a freak has thoroughly broken me beyond repair. No matter what I do it never gets better, because someone sees my vulnerabilities and stabs at it. Because that's what men fucking do, tear each other to pieces at any opportunity, like rats. Now all I see myself as is a subhuman freak that should have his throat slit, while the pigs that ruined me enjoy lives filled with friends and women. I truly, utterly hate men, with all my heart, they're animals, and, because I was passive they ruined me.Now I'm an animal too.I wish I could eliminate all men save for the ones in my family and my few friends. Because, far as I can see, every one of them is as evil at their core as the last.",0

"I'll try to summarize where my life is at right now. In about 3 months time, I've fucked everything up and I'm at a place right now where for the first time in my life, I can't find anything to keep me afloat. First of all, I'm 29. In May this year, I lost my job, and I didn't find a new job immediately. I had some trips and festivals planned this summer, and since I got fired I had some security with an unemployment income. In June, I moved into a new apartment with a new roommate. This had been planned for a while. It cost me some money of course, and the apartment was a bit more expensive than the previous one. Over the summer, a long string of bad decisions lead to serious financial trouble. I started abusing my credit card, spending money I didn't have. Right now, my balance is at -3500 EU, and my bank called me up to announce that I have to clear this debt by September 15th. I cancelled an upcoming vacation, and furiously started looking for a job. It's been harder than I expected, and right now I don't have the time to get that money, so my breathing space is decreasing one day at a time. I've been trying to keep it together and build things up again constructively, but I've been suffering. I'd been investing a lot of time in this girl I met, and there was a real prospect of a relationship. Once I didn't decide to go on the vacation, she kind of kicked me when I was down and made things worse by throwing all kinds of insults and blames at me. Obviously, this is not the kind of person I need in my life so I broke this off instantly. Yesterday, my roommate announced after only 3 months that he doesn't want to live with me anymore because of this insecurity, which I don't blame him for. For the last month now I've been trying to stay positive. I stopped using drugs, stopped smoking, stopped smoking weed, recovered my rhythm, started working out again, dealt with all the shit that had been piling up for months, and I've been looking for a job intensively. Today though, I couldn't keep it together anymore. I'm usually a pretty positive person, and I've always enjoyed some uncertainty in my life as I was always able to see new opportunities in everything. For the first time now, I don't have any security and I can't seem to find anything that gives me the energy to continue. I know all of this has been my own fault, as I've been running away from my problems way too long. A lot of people whom I considered friends (the girl and the roommate to start with, but all the other friends I planned on going on the vacation with too) have been dropping me like I have some infectious disease. There is not a single aspect of my life that isn't shitty right now. My financial situation is dramatic, I'm out of options and time is running out. I don't know where I'm gonna live in a few months, or how I'm even gonna pay for it. The prospect of a relationship has all of a sudden disappeared, a lot of my ""friends"" are gone, the job hunt is giving me one disappointment after the other... And right now I just can't see a way out. My life is in the gutter, and any prospect I had is now gone. For a few weeks now, I've been fighting thoughts of suicide. But every time I worry about my situation, I end up with only one possible solution. Every time I come to that solution, it's becoming harder and harder to fight that thought. Today I broke down completely and just started crying my heart out, I even started writing a goodbye letter... It's not the first time I've had thoughts about suicide, the circumstances in my life right now have made those thoughts stronger than ever. My biggest problem is that I could never stand the pressure of the expectations that were put on me. I kind of 'ran away' from home years ago to get away from the pressure, but I've realized that my entire life has been an illusion. My true self has been completely overshadowed by this image of myself I projected onto the world, through which I pretended to be able to fulfill those expectations.As a result, I've always struggled with a heavy identity crisis. I'm sick and tired of pretending to be someone I'm not, but the problem is that I don't know who I really am. I've been looking deep inside, only to find emptiness... I feel like my true self has died years ago, and I'm a ghost that's merely physically present in this body. I could always cope somewhat with this issue by looking for external distractions, by escaping reality. Through the circumstances of my life at the moment, reality has come crashing in, and I no longer have the energy to pretend. I'm down to my most humble self. I've lost all my will to fight, I'm down on my knees. I just need a fucking break already, but the bad news just keeps piling up. My back is against the wall, and I'm not sure how I'm gonna get out of this. I have a few true friends left who I can talk to about this, but I doubt they realize how bad I'm doing... I guess I just needed some place to vent and be honest about how bad my situation is right now.",1

In May this year, I lost my job, and I didn't find a new job immediately. I had some trips and festivals planned this summer, and since I got fired I had some security with an unemployment income. In June, I moved into a new apartment with a new roommate. This had been planned for a while. It cost me some money of course, and the apartment was a bit more expensive than the previous one. Over the summer, a long string of bad decisions lead to serious financial trouble. I started abusing my credit card, spending money I didn't have. Right now, my balance is at -3500 EU, and my bank called me up to announce that I have to clear this debt by September 15th. I cancelled an upcoming vacation, and furiously started looking for a job. It's been harder than I expected, and right now I don't have the time to get that money, so my breathing space is decreasing one day at a time. I've been trying to keep it together and build things up again constructively, but I've been suffering. I'd been investing a lot of time in this girl I met, and there was a real prospect of a relationship. Once I didn't decide to go on the vacation, she kind of kicked me when I was down and made things worse by throwing all kinds of insults and blames at me. Obviously, this is not the kind of person I need in my life so I broke this off instantly. Yesterday, my roommate announced after only 3 months that he doesn't want to live with me anymore because of this insecurity, which I don't blame him for. For the last month now I've been trying to stay positive. I stopped using drugs, stopped smoking, stopped smoking weed, recovered my rhythm, started working out again, dealt with all the shit that had been piling up for months, and I've been looking for a job intensively. Today though, I couldn't keep it together anymore. I'm usually a pretty positive person, and I've always enjoyed some uncertainty in my life as I was always able to see new opportunities in everything. For the first time now, I don't have any security and I can't seem to find anything that gives me the energy to continue. I know all of this has been my own fault, as I've been running away from my problems way too long. A lot of people whom I considered friends (the girl and the roommate to start with, but all the other friends I planned on going on the vacation with too) have been dropping me like I have some infectious disease. There is not a single aspect of my life that isn't shitty right now. My financial situation is dramatic, I'm out of options and time is running out. I don't know where I'm gonna live in a few months, or how I'm even gonna pay for it. The prospect of a relationship has all of a sudden disappeared, a lot of my ""friends"" are gone, the job hunt is giving me one disappointment after the other... And right now I just can't see a way out. My life is in the gutter, and any prospect I had is now gone. For a few weeks now, I've been fighting thoughts of suicide. But every time I worry about my situation, I end up with only one possible solution. Every time I come to that solution, it's becoming harder and harder to fight that thought. Today I broke down completely and just started crying my heart out, I even started writing a goodbye letter... It's not the first time I've had thoughts about suicide, the circumstances in my life right now have made those thoughts stronger than ever. My biggest problem is that I could never stand the pressure of the expectations that were put on me. I kind of 'ran away' from home years ago to get away from the pressure, but I've realized that my entire life has been an illusion. My true self has been completely overshadowed by this image of myself I projected onto the world, through which I pretended to be able to fulfill those expectations.As a result, I've always struggled with a heavy identity crisis. I'm sick and tired of pretending to be someone I'm not, but the problem is that I don't know who I really am. I've been looking deep inside, only to find emptiness... I feel like my true self has died years ago, and I'm a ghost that's merely physically present in this body. I could always cope somewhat with this issue by looking for external distractions, by escaping reality. Through the circumstances of my life at the moment, reality has come crashing in, and I no longer have the energy to pretend. I'm down to my most humble self. I've lost all my will to fight, I'm down on my knees. I just need a fucking break already, but the bad news just keeps piling up. My back is against the wall, and I'm not sure how I'm gonna get out of this. I have a few true friends left who I can talk to about this, but I doubt they realize how bad I'm doing... I guess I just needed some place to vent and be honest about how bad my situation is right now.",0

A few days ago I went out of state for a couple days, and I felt alive again. Now, back home I feel like total shit. I'm doing jack shit for school and fucking up my future, and it's just eating me alive. I can't take it anymore, I'm just so useless and pathetic.

"I'm 15, living with my parents and younger sister.Every day I feel worse regardless of what I do.As a hobby I play video games, so much. If anything, it's an addiction more than a hobby.I'll play mostly TF2, or some retro games from the gba-gcn era, usually replaying games like Zelda, metroid and Mario.Even though this is the only thing maintaining my sanity, I still feel worse after making no progress on something productive in the real world.I've been learning piano for around 5 years, 2 years ago I started grades and I'm at grade 5, I've lost the will to practice as I make no improvements no matter how long I spend revising pieces.I'm unattractive, by society's standards and very underweight.I lack any form of intelligence and my grades have been waning in recent years.Wherever I go I'm treated as though I am an invalid.My only options I have are to drown myself, slit my throat or stab myself, all of which I'm too afraid to actually do.I cut myself and drink heavily behind my parents' backs to not sate an alcohol addiction but to amend my misery and lust for pain.I despise the taste of the tonics I come across in the small cabinet in our dining room, yet I refuse to stop.I don't seek any kind of help, I'm long past that, I'm broken, if anything.With all of the past failed suicide attempts that I had chickened out of and my parents had come across, they have done nothing to prevent my eventual death or help me.How can surpass this fear and muster enough courage to end my sorry life?I'm begging you, I can hardly take it anymore.",1
"I'm 15. I have contemplated killing myself for about a year and I have kind of hit a point. I have a great family and a good life with everything I need. I just don't see any purpose in life. I wake up every morning and curse and punch my wall because I hate living. My friends ask me why I look so pissed off and I just say it's because I have to come to school. I am pissed off that I am alive. I wish I could just end it all but I don't want to because my mom, dad, and sister would be devastated. My sister is about to enter college and I don't want her to become so sad that she drops out or becomes distracted. I don't want to hurt my parents so bad that they think it's their fault or end up suffering for years. I also don't want to kill myself because I feel it would be a disservice to all those that are less fortunate then me. They might have it so bad but they keep struggling through day to day. I have everything I need but yet I'm still not satisfied. Sometimes I lay in bed and cry because I don't see a purpose in living and I think about all the fucked up shit that happens in our world. The universe is so big and time moves so fast I don't think anyone would even miss me. Why does anything I do even matter in the grand scheme of things. Everything I do, good or bad, will be lost and forgotten. Everything I do has no significance and no meaning. I want to reach out for help but I just can't bring myself to do it. I thought about maybe joining the military and trying to go somewhere dangerous so I could die then at least then at least my parents wouldn't be ashamed of me. But that takes to long. I need a solution now. I have played through the scenario in my head multiple times. I would walk, in the middle of the night, to the freeway overpass and jump off. But I just can't bring myself to do it. Recently my grades have started dropping and my parents are mad at me. This is kind of the breaking point. If there was already no point in living why make myself suffer more.",1

"I'm 18 and right after I graduated high school (literally graduation night) I was kicked out of my house which I was being emotionally abused in and now I'm living over 100 kilometres away from my friends and anyone I care about, she held all the stuff I owned there hostage and it took all my saving I had to get it back, I'm sleeping on a cot in my grandfathers basement with 2 other siblings and my stuff gets taken by them daily to the point where I have no socks and no money to buy more. My mom being the manipulative person she is managed to pin all my friends parents against me and I lost a few friends from that and now I couldn't feel more alone, I have no one to talk to and all this built up anger, I know it's not healthy but it's getting to me and I just really want this to be over.",1
"I'm 19 years old person with a clich depressing life situation. I have no job experience, no real friends irl, family is planning to disown me, college denied my application, I made so many wrong turns in life to the point of no return. Also I'm living in a foreign country without able to hold a proper conversation. Right now I'm at home having absolutely nothing to do, trying to find a job is a task I wish I could leave it to the someone else but I realized I'm a so-called adult now. My family constantly pushes pressure on me, I'm very tired, I'm becoming a burden, I don't want to cause anyone troubles. I regret everything, from my decision of going abroad, my life, to the point I wish I was never born. I'm thinking of killing myself whenever my family starts talking to me, they don't make me feel better or trying to guide me in some way. They are adding up the criticsm I already gave myself. I feel like gabage every morning I wake up, I have to suffer another day. I wish I have the courage to go on but realizing that I'm totally alone in this strange land. No one would help someone pathetic like me. I can't stand the way other people look at me when they turn me away, like they pity me. I wish I could just disappear from this world, turn into some kind of flower, star like in fairy tales. I don't really want to live anymore, I'm quite positive at times but when these things hit, I don't see any way out anymore and I just want to end it all here, at a young age with so many unobtainable dreams.",1
"I'm 19, female and I've finally gave up the fight against my depression and anxiety.. been fighting for so long I just can't do it anymore. I no longer enjoy doing anything and spend my days either sleeping as much as I can as it's the closest I can get to death or sitting in my room alone, gave up with seeing my friends it's been 2 months since I've seen anyone apart from my family who I live with.. that's another reason I want to kill myself, my poor family have to put up with me taking out my feelings on them.. unlike my ex boyfriend who chose to leave me, they can't so their forced to listen to it. I know my family love me and I love them so much, but I think it would be for the best. I'm so confused I want to die I can't stop crying, every minute awake I'm wishing I could go back to sleep.. no one actually thinks I will kill myself so they don't bother really trying to make me feel better, all i'd need is someone to push me and to really help me but i don't have that. I guess i'm here hoping for someone to give me a reason to live, i have thought through and realise that death is forever but we're all going to die someday anyways so why does it matter :( ",1
im 20 years old and have severe anxiety and depression. It's gotten to the point where I just don't care what happens. I know people would be sad if I died but i just dont care anymore.im just so scared to talk to people but being lonely is really hurting me. im crying just typing this out bc im scared of what people might say to me. i got bullied severely in middle school and it destroyed any confidence i've had. im scared to leave my house bc im worried i will get hurt.  i dont care enough to change anything so i just stay in my room all day and pray to god to give me a sign to stay alive but i never get anything.sorry for this jumbled mess,1
"I'm 21.. and I don't know what to do anymore.
I used to have dreams, hobbies, happiness, goals and a purpose to keep trying for a better life. But now.. i don't.
I have a little problem with social skills... I don't know how to express my feelings into words, to communicate with the others, even just a normal conversation. I have been silent for too long that i almost forgot how to speak, even in my own mother language. I don't have any friends and i can't make new friends because i can't trust anyone and i'm really afraid... to say goodbye. 
I used to not be like this... To be honest, i miss my old self.
I used to be a naughty, talkative, energetic kid because i want my mom attention, to be accepted and loved... and cause i also hate school. I've always felt marginalized, unwanted and inferior to my siblings... I envy them. Im not good at anything but i still want her to look at me and talk to me and hug me... We finally did, she finally looked at me and tried to understand what's inside my head. I was really happy till we found out she has cancer, stage 3. My father came back from nowhere after left us with debt,... to be with mom and help the hospital bills. Its still haunting me when she was crying in agony, begging to be dead and apologized for leaving her kids behind...
Im... dying. I shut down eveything, locked myself and tried to kill myself. My father is dating someone right after my mom died. He left the house, took my little brother with him. My mind is completely blank, I dont know what to think nor say. It just empty... It was bad at that time but i got over it and stood up, working on a new goal.
I went to college, multimedia art school. My father hate it and against me going to art school because he doesn't like my art. So I studied alot to get good grades to prove that he is wrong. I have had 3 jobs at once to earn more money for school and subsistence fee. I tried my best to make new friends and I met my first love in college. Things went well until shit happened... I've been betrayed by my first love, tricked by my co-workers and the clients didn't pay me. I got really sick and its keep getting worse ( I have lost more than 20kg due to sickness, stress and insomnia ). I have a fear of asking for help, but at that time i have no choice so i took all my brave to ask my family and friends for help... And they turned me down
I gave up... It's awful. My scores getting worse each day no matter how hard i tried. Everything just collapsed and i can't hold on anymore. I quit my jobs, dropped out of my school, locked myself again... I have started to sleep a lot, the longest is nearly 3 days and still feel tired and always tired... End up spent nearly a year just lying in bed, doing nothing!! I tried again. I went out and find a job that fit me and tried again. I found a new hobby, and spent all the money i have saved to learn tattooing. I really think it's going to work this time, but once again i failed. Im a fool, a failure... Im useless, worthless,, I cant do anything right or think properly. People are so selfish, mean, ungraceful, judgmental and deceivable!! They are terrifying me. Im so tired, of everything. I just want to meet my mom, hug her and go to sleep with her... forever.
Im tired, im good for nothing. I dont have any purpose to keep trying. Im afraid of going outside, talking to people. I have so many negative thoughts and it keep drowning me. I cant go out anymore. My art suck, no one like it!! Everyone is a liar. No matter how much i try, things will never change. I cant do anything, Im stuck... Father is going to sell my mom's house to pay the debt... I dont get along well with my siblings, family... I have tried too much, I pretend to be alright, always fake a smile so people stop asking and giving me more pressure. But now... I dont know what to do now... I dont even know what to think...",0
I'm 22 male. My girlfriend left. I've been staying late in the office for too long because I can't cope with the workload.Friends are non existent.Hate my family and they hate me. I just want to die I don't see any other option at this point,1
"I'm 24 and have Asperger's syndrome. I go to college, trying to get a good job, finishing my associates, wanted to go into computer science but I'm so fucking stupid I'll probably fuck that up too. If I'm not in school, I'm working. I don't really have ""friends"" just acquaintances that come into my life when it's convenient for them. I feel like such a freak, I can't pick up on simple communication cues and never know how to express myself emotionally to people. When people are sad or crying to me and expressing themselves, I never know what to do or say or even feel, I can blame Asperger's all I want but that won't change the fact I feel like I don't belong on the same planet as normal people do. Medication just makes me a robot, so I stopped. People say I'm hilarious but that's not a trait that will get me anywhere in life and it can be hard when I'm usually sarcastic and people just ""don't get it"". My gf of 5 years cheated on me and hasn't spoken to me since I found out, the one person I felt safe with is now gone from my life. I feel like I'm in some sort of glass room just watching everyone else and no matter what I do I can't break the room due to genetics and my failure of a mind. Should I just end it so I can quit ruining people's lives and hating my own? I'd rather hope for a second life where I can actually enjoy being a normal person than continue living as a failure.

"I'm 29 and my life was very normal growing up. Was valedictorian in college, had two seemingly loving parents and a fiancee I'd been dating since I was 18. About six years ago I discovered that my fiancee was cheating on me and I was devastated. She quickly married this guy after six years of dating me. I moved back in with my parents and things were ok for a while. I had a good job but I was having a lot of problems getting back on my feet emotionally. Then it turned out that my mom was cheating on my dad and he confronted her about it. That week they both died in a car accident, with the suspicion that my mom (the driver) did it on purpose as a murder-suicide kind of thing related to the affair. I am living in their house, my childhood home, and am starting to have a hard time paying the rent. I've been able to keep it up for now because the bank is letting me keep paying it as the executor of their estate but I don't even know if I'll be able to refinance and it's cheaper than paying rent anywhere. I might end up homeless if it doesn't work out.I am in therapy and it does not seem to help. I don't get social media and don't even have a phone. The one friend I did have killed himself a few years ago, before all this happened.I have this feeling that my life is not real and that everything from this point on is just meaningless. Whatever happens I feel like I'm controlling a body that is not my own, and I have these thoughts that all ""I"" am is just a series of electrical impulses going through meat. When I die I'll forget I ever existed, forget the concept of existence in the first place because there will be no conceptual realization of consciousness whatsoever. The universe will cease to exist and will be like it never existed, just like it must be for my parents now. All those experiences and things I've made, all the people I've ever met and loved, will be unmade in an instant.During my daily routine of going to my office and then home, I am starting to see things. I am seeing the lights turn out when they are actually on. I am seeing faces peering at me from doors left cracked. I see my parents and even my old girlfriend in my dreams every night and wake to a reality that is not my own. I can barely plod through work and my days seem to happen without me having any knowledge about them. I sit at my desk and am vividly trapped in endless loops of memories - songs, experiences, movies, smells that defined my life throughout high school and college, the things that seem so desperately to be ""me"" even though the world goes on without me. Since the day I graduated I feel like I have been in stasis, watching the world around me change and evolve while I slowly degrade due to incompatibility. The loss of my fiancee was a big blow, and the death of my parents is a far greater shock that I cannot even describe. They were really my only friends, and now I am caught in an endless cacophany of betrayal and bottomless sadness.I just heard a baby cry in my office and there is nobody else here. I have about ten or so moments like this during the day.Sometimes I dream that I will hang myself by the neck over a small bridge near my house. It's never a rope but always a heavy metal chain. Sometimes I can feel a loose link cutting into my neck as I take the plunge over the side. It's endless - either the hanging or my lost loved ones, or both. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, or even more importantly WHY I should keep it up. I feel like my entire existence is a mistake and that I will always be spending my life pining for a time long gone, listening for voices long dead.I don't know what I'm doing here but I had to type this out and I don't know if it made things better, but I typed it out nonetheless. Thank you for listening.",1

"I'm 32 years old and my life is completely fucked up. To sum it up, I'm a porn director living in L.A. All my life, I wanted to be an actual film-maker like John Ford and James Cameron, but life is not what's it's cracked up to be and in order to find work, I had to work in porn. After sending my scripts over to studios like Warner Bros and Fox, I got turned every time and even to do this day, I still get turned down. I've been directing porn for nine years and I'm just tired of it, I didn't want this and now, I'm going to kill myself! I'm sorry baby, I know I was the best thing you ever had, but i'm done, I don't want to be a part of this sleazy industry anymore! I'm done! ",1
"I'm 32, I was born with cerebral palsy. All my adult life I heard from people how cushy it must be to live off their taxes because I got disability.In 2009 I enrolled in college and earned an Associate's in medical billing. I graduated in 2013 and stayed on to earn a Bachelor's in Management which I earned this year.At the time I was making $675 a month disability but was able to live because of my best friend and roomie who helps me with bills.In 2014 I took on a job and alerted social security, I was told I had 3 years I could work. I was never told I needed to show them my paystubs, I gladly worked and attended class feeling happy to be working, to be in class. I'd show the people who called me a leech that I could be more, I'd get off disability for myself.It's 2017, I've graduated, can find no work and have now been told by Social Security that I owe them $26,000 in over payment because I was never supposed to get payments from 2014 onward.They had my employer send them a 3 year print out of all my earnings, when I called them to ask why I owed and why, if they needed me to turn in my paystubs they never told me, they replied, ""we don't have to tell you, you were supposed to know.""I called them today to plead my case, that with rent, student loans, etc, I only have around $100 a month left, and that I barely make over $1,000 a month since my benefits stopped.I was told that I should send them, ""at least $100 a month, more if you can, even then it will take you 21 years to pay us back, you want to get this done sooner if you can.""I feel so fucking hopeless. All I wanted to do was have a better life, an education. To stop hearing, ""must be nice to sit on your ass and live off MY taxes.""Now I'm in debt I will never get out of, every attempt to find work has fallen through (I can't drive as it's $2000+ to put hand controls in our car), and I just, why go on?I only haven't killed myself because I can't bare the thought of my best friend finding me.

"im a 17 yo boy.
i always help anyone, i always give everything what i have, i never asked for help or anything. im trying my best but im still fucking useless.
i want to die so hard since years, i have nothing to live for. i hate everything and everybody.. nothing, seriously NOTHING and NOBODY interests me, i cant get excited about girls anymore. human body is disgusting, i just cant think about sex more, it makes me sick
i hate talking because everybody so fucking selfish, i just stopped talking with people some years ago, they ask but i know they dont really care about what im saying. thats why my environment thinks that im a totally okay quiet kid and they will be surprised when i kill myself.
i feel that im the worst, i dont think i deserve to have relationships with other people, i deserve to die slowly and painfully, i hope i get cancer or something like that. rarely whenever i think someone is nice and may she/he can be my friend or wtf i always think about how many other friends/girlfriends/relatives/family members she/he can have and im getting feel myself useless because why that human want to me if they can have other friends who are definitely better than me!?
thats why ive got nobody who loves me, except my mom, but i hate her because she loves me.. i didnt ask her to take care of me! she's just making my life harder, i can be dead now years ago if she didnt make me feel remorse about it. im waiting for my mothers death, so then finally i can kill myself easily.
i never asked for attention and i still dont want it, i hate it! but at least one time in my life i want to do something selfish: suicide. and i just cant fucking do that. im so scared about it, i make plans about it every night, im begging for a surprise accident or whatever what can kill me, just kill meactually i dont need help, i dont want to get better, i dont need answers, i just have to tell someone what i feel, so thank you.
i know i will kill myself by a train, i just dont know when. maybe today or tomorrow but i said it 2 months ago too, so maybe i can survive 2017, but when i finally have one more reason for it, i will do it.",1
"Im a 19 year old girl. I am terrified of death to the point where my life is now being wasted on severe anxiety and dread. I have developed severe physical symptoms and have been referred urgently for a scan of my brain to detect any neurological conditions. I am terrified that there's something wrong with me, but at the same time I think it's possible that I am having such a massive mental breakdown that it's manifesting in me physically. I was psychologically abused for years by my father and still am experiencing his abuse. I was also sexually assaulted at 14 and I never got help for any of it and I feel that I have finally completely cracked. For the past month I have been so constantly frightened that I haven't slept properly for even one night and have been having vivid nightmares and constant intrusive thoughts that I can't distract my mind from. I have also lost over a stone in weight in a few weeks. I have been having intrusive thoughts about illness and death, and what the meaning of life all is and whether everything is all just a figment of my imagination. I feel like I've really dissociated from reality even though I'm aware I'm doing it. I'm looking at people's faces and am just seeing flesh and eyeballs etc rather than a person, it's like I feel like everything is just completely surreal, like everything has become so absurd to me suddenly that I can't even see it for what it is. I also feel like my left side of my body is going numb and it feels detached to my body, which is why I'm having a scan. I feel completely unable to go on like this. I am terrified and feel like I might just suddenly die. I keep thinking about how I can stop this feeling immediately, but I am terrified of death so I know this isn't a way out, but I don't know what else is... I'm scared I'm going to either go insane or just jump out in front of something impulsively... I've been to A&E and told them this, but no one will help me... I'm a young girl so I still look okay even though I feel like I'm in the worst mind state possible... I am truly scared for myself and have no one to turn to or care for me and am being dismissed by mental health professionals... I am very lost and afraid",1
"I'm a 22 year old female and I feel like giving up. Here are my issues...My dad (who was my LIFE) died suddenly on Thanksgiving.Because of this, we got evicted from my childhood home.We could no longer afford to send me to the college of my dreams, but my mom opened up a bunch of credit cards in my name and made me believe I was going back to school next semester. So I had to scramble to find a school that would take me. My credit is ruined.I attempted suicide to be with my dad againAfter the suicide attempt, I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophreniaI lost my pilot's license due to schizophrenia and not being able to pass the medical anymoreMy mom stole all my money for drugs My mom is pregnant and refuses to go see a doctor or anything and I'm worried about my future siblingI failed a class and had to switch majors.I finally got into the program of my dreams, only to get in a wreck and be taken to jail on count of DUI. The only good news is this case was dropped once they proved that I was NOT intoxicated while driving. However, I got kicked out of my program until the case was resolved. Then I went to re apply for the program but it was already full, even though I tried on the first dayThe car accident mentioned above knocked out 6 of my front teeth. I'm 22 and I have dentures.At my old job, the manager spent the entire time berating me and accusing me of lying and threatening me.I feel like I'm leaving stuff out, but that's the main point. Thanks for listening. I don't want this stuff on my suicide note because I don't want anybody to feel guilt. I know they will anyway, but all in all it's best if I just quit now...",1
"I'm a 26 year old male living with his mom for financial reasons. She verbally and emotionally abused me all my life, saying I ruined her life and that she wished she aborted me, that I was useless and fucked up and barely a human being (due to my introversion and lack of affection for her). She was a drunk and let her boyfriends threaten to kill me when I defended her from them and would ask me to forgive them and give them another chance. I never felt like she actually wanted a child. I've never felt loved by her and I feel like I'm incapable of forgiving or loving her at this point. That being said, in recent years she's acknowledged her abuse and realized her part in my development of clinical depression. She's still very harsh towards me sometimes and always assumes the worst of me but it's nothing like it used to be. I can also stand up for myself a bit better and often prove how irrational she's being. Earlier today, I overheard her talking to her friends about how useless I am. It felt like in an instant I reverted back to my childhood and I felt sick. It's like all her development is fake. It upset me but I didn't think truly bothered me until I just found myself thinking ""I wish I was worth something."" I keep looking up suicide methods which I haven't done in years. I've attempted before so it scares me a bit that this isn't beyond my ability  The thing is, I objectively know I'm not really worthless. I have a college education, am a good writer, have a beautiful girlfriend that I love and amazing friends who value me. I'm capable of learning. The only issue right now is I have no idea what I'm doing with my life career wise. I don't have a job. I'm lost and I feel like I might not even be capable of a normal job because of severe social anxiety. The urge to just end it is growing stronger. I don't know how to convince myself that I don't deserve this. I don't know how to tell myself that my mom's words mean nothing and are bullshit. She's shaped me in so many ways, all of them negative, and I feel trapped. I feel like the only way to escape her is dying.I just need to find a way to convince myself otherwise. ",1
"I'm a college freshman, and it's been more difficult than I thought. I've made friends who say they care, but I can't shake the feeling that I'll meet someone or already have met someone who will end up hurting me or deserting me. I've only known them for a month but they already know about my suicidal ideation. I've been having panic attacks every night and I'm sick of it. I'm terrified that people are annoyed with me or think I'm seeking attention because of it. I'm terrified that they'll eventually just stop caring and they'll leave. I'm trying to navigate my identity as a polyamorous queer girl but I don't even know how I can do that if I'm terrified of even making friends with people. I know friends are supposed to be there but I can't keep relying on them for support every single night when I know I'll just weigh them down. I can't even pick up the phone to talk to someone. I just want to stop being scared and feel secure. I just want to feel like someone cares besides my parents. I don't want to be alone for four years. ",1

I'll never claim perfection and I know that's impossible but other people seem to do pretty well. I'd like to meet their standards at least. Most of the time I can not care but some days it all just piles on. Getting help hasn't worked. Taking time out just distracts briefly and is a cover up. This is me. Forever.

Nothing works.
I spent the whole day crying over a mistake. I stayed in bed. I didn't want to face the people in my house,  so I didn't eat dinner. Am I being too dramatic?  Maybe. I just don't want to do life right now. I know it'll go away but in that time I wanted to die so badly. I wish I could do it. ",1

"I'm a fourteen year old girl who is a freshman in high school. I've dealt with depression for years, hiding it until one day I told my parents. They looked at me like I was broken, and everything made me uncomfortable. I started taking medicine. It got me feeling a little better, and I was improving so much, I was so happy, and then high school started. I fell down a cliff, and now I can't get up. They think I'm better. Though they're starting to suspect something's up, how I never go out of my room or anything. But as soon as they ask me, it's like the real me is trapped and my depression takes over saying, ""I'm fine, I'm just really tired."" Or when they ask me if I'm suicidal, ""No no no, I'm not. With school starting, I just haven't had enough time."" I don't even think. My mind just creates a situation that's not the full truth. Not even close. I don't know how to tell anyone. I'm living each day waiting for it to be over, until the only thing I look forward to is sleeping, and obviously, watching Netflix because tv shows consume me. Anyways, I can't live life like this, waiting for the day to be over, every single day, for the next four years. I think about suicide. But I can't do it because I think about my parents. How they'll miss me, I make them laugh, and that's what's keeping me alive, along with my dog. But I just can't stand to live like this any longer, and it's too hard asking for help. School is making me so suicidal. I've been really depressed before, but not so much where I actually envisioned my death and the least painful way to go through with it. Which is what I'm doing now. I'm sorry this is so long. I'm rambling out everything I have to say, which doesn't even seem like enough right now.

"I'm a psychopath
i would rather die than do my homework,or any work at all.
I feel like more than half of my life i'm doing what i hate do to,the other 10% of my life is doing what i like to do.I really hate highschool,i hate how life is just pure pain.
You want to be happy? NOPE
You will have to go trough depression,to fake your happiness so that everyone doesen't judge you or exclude you,and to hide your suicidal thoughts from your parents,because you love them and don't want them to feel bad.I'm not impressed about dying,i'm also an atheist, and the idea of nothing at all for forever sounds great to me.
I really don't think that suicide is a big deal,is just that people consider death a bad thing because we only know life,but at this point anything would be better than living.
I'm not suicidal because i hate myself or because someone bullied me, i'm suicidal because i realized that life always strikes you down,and sometimes you just want to stay on the ground without having to get up again.
And, if our science is right, we are just microscopic specs living in a giant floating rock in space,surrounded by nothingness and a big giant star that's going to eat our stupid planet in a few million years i believe, so that doesn't help.
Everything you think is important isn't,because in the end nothing matters,when humanity dies,everything we did, good things,bad things,global warming and so on will disappear,and nothing will be worth it.I would have already committed suicide if it wasn't for two things:
-My parents,i love them and i just can't imagine how much it would hurt them
-Pain, i'm really obsessed with pain,and i just really want to go to sleep and never wake up,to remove all my problems,my homework,my sadness and my daily existencial crisis.I'm sorry i just wanted to get that out of my sistem,any advice on what to do now?",1

"I'm already feel dead I'm just not pronounced yet...
My first memory was my dad telling me he's moving out of my house. Although still in contact with him, I'm forced by my mother and father to pick sides. One of my sisters sided with my dad, the other with my mom, and I'm stuck in the middle. Police calls and fights lasted for years and I hated every minute of my life. I had no friends I could take to about my problems but I was too young to even think about suicide.
Then I met the love of my life at the young age of 16.  My life had purpose again. I told her my whole life story and I loved doing it because she actually cared. Year after year she was still there for me and I felt like I had a reason to love. My only good memories in my life are along side her.
4 years later we broke up because I lied to her. This is when I really died. When you have no one to talk to you get used to it.. but when you had someone to talk to that is now gone forever and it's all my fault, well you don't get used to that.

They laugh, because my ex came out as a lesbian, mere days after she left me, mere days after my Nana was cremated. My best friends, who've stood by me for 5 years have just gotten up, and left me behind whilst they have the time of their lives at tresham. I'm forever being compared to everyone, the same everyone that confuses me with my perverted cuntsack of a brother. The same brother who goes from trying to kill me, to supposedly loving me in seconds. My parents have just given up on the failure I am. Hell, even the school fucking counselors have given up on me. I just want it to end and there's nothing else I want more than to just tie my school tie, the same one that everyone signed on the last day of year 11, so tight that it strangles me. Wouldn't that make things so much fucking better? No one would have to bother laughing at the biggest fucking failure this shit stain of a town has ever seen, or tolerating me stuttering and stumbling. Hell, even the school itself hates me: all the teachers know that everyone hates me, yet it took one guy nearly breaking open my cast whilst he beat the shit out of me, under a security camera, for them to even contemplate doing anything about it.",1

"I'm at the point in my life now where I genuinely don't know if I want to live anymore. It's 50/50. Half of me wants to live and half of me wants non-existence. I feel like suicide would be the ultimate freedom.I first started really considering suicide when my OCD got to the point where I would do retarded repedetive shit and have non-stop tormenting OCD thoughts all day, every single day. I have for the most part overcome my OCD now, but the thoughts of suicide remain.I am a 19 year old high school dropout, unemployed, porn and cigarette addict, virgin, never had a girlfriend and pretty socially isolated nowadays. I don't feel connected to anyone. I don't feel any love for anyone. Not even my own immediate family. I don't feel close to anyone. I am pretty numb and dead inside.I see a lot of people say they wish they could kill themselves, but couldn't do that to the people around them. I don't feel that way at all. It may make me a selfish piece of shit, but I honestly could give a fuck how my suicide affects anyone. It's my life and I will be dead, so I literally won't be able to give a fuck.I have tried countless times to turn my life around in past, but inevitably ALWAYS end up failing.I'm still on the fense about whether or not I want to kill myself. So my plan is to give myself until June 1st, 2018 (a week before I turn 20) to try my best to show myself that my life is worth living. If I can't do that and am still in this same position by then, then it is time to end this once and for all.I can't take this same old cycle of the same old bullshit any longer then 8 months. It must end one way or another. It will end either through self-improvement or suicide.",1

I know my parents do it too but they don't know I know. they have a dab pen, my brother found it and invited me too do it with him, but that's not the main reason I'm deppressed.

"I'm committing suicide today (in approximately 17hrs, today is also my birthday.  Ask me anything.",1
"I'm considering suicide because I am an absolute failure at life, failed academically, failed socially, failed everything. There's nothing in my life worth salvaging. I think about my family a lot, what it would put them through, and that blocks me from doing it, committing to it. But what harm is it to them really? They will be depressed for a little while and then get over it. My mother is the one I'm worried about the most, she is very weak mentally and wouldn't be able to get over it. But at the same time she has religion, and I think that'd give her strength. I hope so at least. I've considered writing in my suicide note that I asked for forgiveness for what I'm about to do, and I'm not a religious person, but if asking for forgiveness helps my mother deal with it, then I'd definitely do it. My brother and sister would be depressed for a little while but I see them getting through it, they are strong. My dad would be angry at me and rightfully so, but I don't think he'd have a hard time getting over it. I've thought a lot about losing out on happy experiences and all that, but the way I see it, it's better that someone who is happy and fulfilled in life gets to experience those things instead, and I know that those people are out there experiencing those things, so its not so bad. Someone gets to do it, it just won't be me. I have a noose made and a place I want to go to do it, but I don't think its long enough and I'm afraid I'll botch it. There's also a shotgun in the house that I can use, but it'll be really hard to get access to it, since my dad has hidden the key ever since my first attempt. I'm terrified that my family will blame everything and anything and end up getting frustrated and angry at the whole thing, but it's entirely my own fault. I'm entirely to blame. I want them to blame me but not hate me. And I guess thats all I can do.",0
I'm contemplating suicide. Again.,1
"I'm currently 29 and I have been suicidal since age 5. I remember running away in the middle of the night at age 5, hoping to find something....anything to take me away. Death, a stranger, anything. Now I am 29. Life hasn't been bad for me, and I feel guilty wanting to die whilst living a relatively comfortable life. But I can't stop thinking about the sweet release of death. I've been working 40+ hours a week since I was 14 and I haven't found anything I'm very interested in. People are the same no matter where you go or what you do. Just self-absorbed and uncaring. All these comments on this sub and all the suicide-prevention shit is just feel good rhetoric for the care-givers of the world. It's all empty gestures and fake smiles. I can't take all the fake people anymore. I can't tell who is more empty inside, me or them.More than anything, I want to be rid of money. I used to be a friendly, outgoing kid who enjoyed meeting people. Now when I meet someone I am instantly skeptical of how they are planning to rip me off.IDK why I'm posting this. Fuck it.",1
"I'm currently in the middle of a long journey by train after a distressing thing that happened earlier today. I can't hold back the tears. I want to cry and scream but I can't. I feel helpless and the only thing I can think of is wanting to end the pain that's in my chest and stop the thoughts. And that's the only thing that gives me comfort - the thought that this can all end as soon as I get out of this miserable journey. I don't really have the energy to type out the whole story here, but suffice to say that I'm tired of people I love treating me without any empathy at all. I'm on the way to having a good career, and I'm fairly talented, but I feel that my life is a waste. I smile at people at work all day and pretend that I'm okay. But I cry a lot; I oftentimes take a walk alone and just cry. My own family thinks that whatever distresses me isn't serious, and sometimes say that I'm just messed up on the inside, or if it were that serious I'd have tried to do something drastic already. I see a therapist but I get no real help. I almost want to end my life just to prove them wrong.I want these episodes where I just cry, cry, and cry to just stop. I feel horrible and helpless and it takes a lot for me to convince myself that tomorrow will be a better day.There are a few days when I'm happy, but every night before I go to sleep I always hope that tomorrow is not the day when it all ends again for me. And then I go through days and days of just trying to survive because I have to. The problem is, I want to survive, it's just that people around me seem to try to do everything to prevent this whenever they figure out my vulnerability.My only hope in life is to be happy in the long-term but after many years of struggling, I just want to know why shit always seems to happen.Now that I'm trying not to cry in a public place where people are just trying to peacefully live their lives, I think I've hit a new low that I didn't think was possible, where I shed tears uncontrollably in a public place. I've seen people laugh. I hate myself and I hate that my life has taken this turn.I'm expected at work tomorrow, dressed up, looking good, and my suffering tonight will have been for nothing. My life won't have changed and no one still understands my pain. ",1
I'm desperate. I want to escape this shit existence.And when I get like this I like to fantasize my own demise.  I don't want to hurt anyone but myself. Are cops trained to shoot to kill? I wouldn't want to mentally hurt a police officer (or police officers if more then one is called to the scene) but I feel it's apart of their training to potentially take a life. I fantasize about a group of them just shooting me to death. I fantasize about aiming a black spray painted water pistol at them and them responding by spending their entire magazines on me. I fantasize about having my suicide note zipped up in two ziplock bags so that it's legible after the fountain of blood coming from me dousing it.The fantasy of this actually makes me feel a lot better.,1

I'm going to start this post by saying that I'm really high and sad and this will probably be a ramble and not formatted well as I'm on mobile. I'm 18 with nothing but a handful of cheap clothes and 1 set of already too old contacts for my vision. I still have another 2 weeks before my first paycheck and another month before my first big one. My only place to live is with my girlfriend. And she knows that so she treats me like shit knowing I can't leave. I treat her like a princess to not get kicked out yet I still get accused and yelled at for always ruining our relationship. Everytime we have sex I'm always doing things for her and we have days were I don't cum while I put in the time to satisfy her in multiple ways. She doesn't trust me and always thinks I'm cheating or I'm going to cheat just because I use to mess around a lot before we got together. I'm honestly at the point where I want to break up with her but I can't handle the consequences. I havent been this depressed in a while. I'm more depressed now than my last suicide attempt. Yet somehow I havent genuinely considered it. It's just that it's hard for me to see a future for myself. I always fuck up my own life. I fuck it up and I'm okay with it. I do things I know are going to make my life harder and I tell myself it's what I want. Just to please someone else. I'm so nice to everyone in hopes that good karma will come back. I always said one more year one more year. And that karma will come back. Yet no one has ever showed me the love that I give to every single person in my life. How do you meet new people?

I try to kid myself and say I'm a good person - people say that I am, my girlfriend says that I am. But I know I'm not. I'm the biggest asshole there is. The only thing stopping me is knowing that suicide may cause a lot of inconvenience to people. Who am I kidding, they don't care. I want to stop hurting and crying every day.",1

"I'm keeping this short and sweet; I'm a 19f that has aspergers sydrome, and I've got awful anxiety. It stops me from doing so much, and I can't even think of the future because if it. I've been depressed and suicidal in the past and I thought it was over me, but now it's returned. My anxiety is so bad I can't see a way to live. I can't even cook a fucking egg it's that bad, and my social life? No fucking existence. My friends don't even acknowledge me outside of school. I've been battling with suicidal thoughts this past month, but I love my family too much to carry it out. But now it's 1 in the morning, I looked at all of my pills and I just googled how long it takes to die from an overdose. I'm actually considering this, and it fucking terrifies me. I can't stop crying, and I need help, but years of therapy hasn't helped, so how could it now? I can't run away to a relative's house like I used to because my sister has a formal tomorrow and I don't want to ruin her day by being like 'Surprise! I wanna hang myself again!'

Im not exactly suicidal but I probably will be if I dont seek help soon. What type of person should I talk to? Some details about me inside,1
"I'm not going into too many details mainly because from experience people will take one factoid, make up a whole bunch of stuff in their head and judge you harshly for it, or assume things due to lack of context.But my life is a sack of shit. My family legitimately hate me
I am poor
I have some friends, but don't hear from them unless I get in touch first
I have been single for almost a decade. Generally I am ok with being single but some dates wouldn't go amiss.I literally care about nothing any more. My dreams and goals seem like stupid things that I am not good enough to achieve. I've tried, but depression grinds my world to a halt.Doctors don't help me
Nobody around me seems to understandThis has gone on for 30+ years. I am tired. cant do it any more.I just want to lay down and die quietly. All I want in life is to disappear.",1
I'm not going to try. I've just been thinking. I told one of my coworkers and he laughed at me. I'm not going to tell my boss because everyone here jokes about it but im the only one that doesn't think this is funny. ,0
"I'm not gonna sit here and say, my life sucks, wah I never get what I want, etc. But I just need to talk about this because might as well post it publically when no one that I'm friends with gives a crap. so pretty much, I thought that getting a job would help distract me from my depression but I think it got worse. First off I'm extremely lonely, there's a girl I'm interested in but I know for sure that even if I were to confess how I felt to her, it wouldn't work out because I'm a garbage human, I've been seriously lonely for a long time and the only time I've ever had a S/O was in high school, but then again she had autism so she most likely didn't care about me romantically. Then there was the other attempt I had at telling someone how I felt, and she though said that she loved me, left me to rot afterwards. So you can see where I'm getting at with being tired of being lonely all of the damn time. There's that, and there's also that I'm an artist, and that's been dragging me down lately too, since I keep drawing but I never get better despite everyone telling me to practice and practice, well gee, nothing is getting better so it OBVIOUSLY ISN'T WORKING!
I'm just sick of it, I don't even see a point in wanting to keep on living anymore because of my depression eating me away everyday. I know I sound bitchy and whiny, but I just want out, I might buy myself a gun if I have to just to end it. Or maybe jump off the tallest bridge here in my city",0
"I'm not mentally stable or happy since last 8 years. I'm in depression since then. I can't afford to sit idle now. The only thing which is making me live is my mother. I'm living, struggling only because I want to take care of her.She always suggested me not to escape from any situations. But, now I'm sensing it is the only way out for me. I have almost no friends. I can't share my thoughts, regrets or anything with anyone, which I believe is killing me too. I had given 5-6 interviews in last 6 days but no affirmation. Only thing which is killing me is my pathetic sadistic and capricious nature. While I can think that I worth something, most of the times, I believe everyone is living their life perfectly, laughing, enjoying. I don't know what should I do now. It seems ending a life is the final option for me now. ",1
"I'm not really planning on it, but sometimes I find myself thinking that it would be a relief so often, that I don't know why my mind is still averse to the thought of actually doing it. I mean I still have a few basic reasons not to, like the fact that it would hurt some people, and I genuinely worry that if I commit suicide it might trigger one or two more, and I always want to imagine that I'll figure things out someday.But the thought of dying sounds so relieving. I never feel relief in my life. Relief is super rare but I still keep doing things and pushing forward and I feel like this lack of relief will always keep me too demotivated to make positive changes. So why not just end it?Sometimes though, I wish someone in my personal life would hear my problems and instead of getting uncomfortable or having some typical reaction, would actually be concerned and just give me an understanding ear.",1
"I'm not really sure how much information is generally acceptable in these posts but since I'm feeling this way for a lot of reasons I think it'd be easiest to start with some background. I'm twenty years old and in my third year of college and I haven't done anything meaningful with my life. I've been ostracized by peers for as long as I can remember and I'm trapped in a cycle of social anxiety that prevents me from being anything more than acquaintances with others. I can't get a jobI can't even get volunteer positionsand I live with my parents and am financially dependent on them. I feel like calling me a loser would be generous.I'm also struggling because I recently came out to my family and some relatives haven't taken it as well as I'd expected; one of them became very abusive until I backed off and basically retracted what I had said earlier about my identity. Before this, I'd been hoping to join lgbt groups on campus but now I feel like it would set people off (and most of the people I've met in the community are a lot more outgoing than I am, and I feel really out of place).I honestly don't feel like a person and I have nowhere to turn for support. All I can think about is hanging myself and after at least ten years of feeling isolated and almost constantly suicidal I feel like I'm finally reaching a breaking point.Sorry this got so long.",1
I'm not really sure if I'm suicidal,1
"I'm not sad or angry, really. For the past few years, I've honestly had probably the best life I can imagine. I haven't been insanely wealthy, but I've managed to make enough money with minimal work to be able to do whatever I've wanted. I've been able to sleep/stay up as late as I want with no repercussions, I've done a fair amount of traveling, and had an above average love life. I've seen amazing sights, eaten at top-caliber restaurants, and had virtually zero stress.Now, it seems, that's coming to an end. The steady flow of money has pretty much stopped, and it's likely that if I'm to continue my life, I'll have to go back to working a regular day job, being burdened with debt, etc. Honestly, I really just don't feel like doing it again. I've tasted the freedom of living a life that gives me whatever I want whenever I want it, and I have absolutely zero desire to go back to living paycheck to paycheck, following someone else's schedule, giving up all of my freedom except that which exists between when I get off of work and when I go to sleep.So that's it. Am I wrong for feeling that way? I feel like I could die today and I would be satisfied to have gotten to live the last few years the way that I have. If I go on, it's unlikely I'll be able to live that way again for another 30-40 years, and then I'll be too old to enjoy it the same way that I have. Just seems kind of pointless to restart, grinding away at a future that has virtually no chance of being as pleasant as my past. Why put in the effort?",1
"I'm not saying I'm a special snowflake because I know most of you on this sub go through worse stuff than me. I know nobody asked for this, so I don't really want to be a whiny brat, but I've honestly had enough. I'm a shitty person. I don't reply to messages from people who are still actually trying to talk to me because it all seems pointless to me. I leave my bed only if it's absolutely necessary, and I hate spending time with others no matter how important those people are to me. I used to love art, but I can't bring myself to create things anymore. At the beginning of summer break I was like, ""I'm going to draw every single day for the following two months, so I can form a habit I'd like to maintain and work hard on becoming an artist."" Well, guess what. Summer break's ending today, and I only sketched once, and it ended up being a piece of garbage. I realized if I actually wanted to be an artist, I'd be passionate and wouldn't know how to live without constantly making art, and that's the exact opposite of me. I usually ended up hating my artwork anyways, so I think there are people much more determined to become artists, and they sure as hell deserve it more than someone like myself. I'm just pretty much numb most of the time, but whenever a tiny inconvenience creeps into my life, my brain instantly goes to 'suicidal mode'. Crippling anxiety takes over me, and my life goes from 0 to -10. The only thing I can think about is death. I use it as a coping mechanism 'Nothing I do matters because we will all die anyways' to make my anxiety less extreme, but it's not very healthy since I start planning my own suicide. I'm changing schools and I'll be in a completely new environment, which makes things even worse because I can't stop imagining the worst scenarios. Basically, right now the best option I have is hanging myself. I messed up everything in my life. I failed my driving exam on my birthday, I couldn't take the pressure at my previous school and I can't keep making art. I honestly don't have any dreams or a future. The only thing I genuinely want is peace.(Please do not suggest therapy/medication. I can't get any professional help right now.)",0
"Im not suicidal and im not depressed. however, ive been thinking about my future and whether its worth it. i still study, hang out with friends, etc, and i would feel like myself, but when im stuck doing hw or something late at night, the thought of death doesnt intimidate me. like i always have this thought everyone dies. its just a matter of when u die.unless ur steve jobs or abe lincoln, a majority of things u did wont matter after death. this leads me to believe that theres no point in trying to make a difference in the world bcuz ill die in a couple of decades (unless im steve jobs or something). i have goals, family and friends, and im in a decent situation (my social life at school could be alot better and i would appreciate less hw and tests).just a little rant. im really bored and stuck doing hw.

"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post, but I don't know what else to do.I'm in the Midwest and I've been unemployed for multiple years struggling to find work.  I've applied for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of jobs, but they never pick me.  I have an IT degree, but I'm stuck in an area that apparently doesn't have any jobs for me.  I've gone to government places, temp agencies, and job recruiting places to look for work and they keep telling me ""Sorry, we have nothing for you right now.""  I've talked to hundreds of different job recruiters and they tell me the same thing.The last ""job"" I had was a year ago and it only lasted a few months.  They said I did a good job but couldn't afford to keep me on.  I called the contract place again to see if they had any other jobs and they said no.  But I was still unemployed for years before I had that job.  I do have some job experience, but the problem is it was many years ago and it looks like employers just don't care anymore.  I've applied for all sorts of jobs, from IT to clerical to retail and warehouse places, but they never pick me.I have anxiety and depression, and over the years I've seen at least 10 different doctors about it and they've tried all sorts of prescriptions and procedures, but nothing ever works.  I can't afford to see anymore doctors unfortunately.  When I'm lucky enough to interview for a job, which is rare, I do my best to cover up the anxiety/depression to at least appear normal, but unfortunately the employer never picks me.  I usually hear ""overqualified"" for all the jobs I apply for.  So I modify my resume to counter this, and I still get nothing.My life just feels completely hopeless and I have no idea what else to do.  I just don't see any other options since I've been rejected by everyone.  I feel so alone and that no one cares about me at all.  Every person I've asked for work, like family and relatives, have told me that they have nothing for me.  I don't want to lose my apartment, but I really have no where else to go.  My family has made it clear they don't want to take care of me.  Plus, I don't have any nearby friends so that doesn't help either.Again, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post so I apologize if it isn't.

I've been studying longer than my peers. It is getting better but recently I started failing exam after exam and it is breaking my spirit because I study for hours every day yet get little result. And then when I say I failed they ask ""well whose fault is that?"". It's fucking mine. Do you need me to spell it out?On top of that, my parents fight. Like, almost daily. It isn't physical as much as it is mentally draining and abusive. Arguing, fights every day, then each complaining about other side to me and making me into a mental trashcan. My only fall back used to be my grandmother but even she recently started putting problems on me because of my insane mother.On top of that, I am eating pounds of candy to artificially keep my mood somewhat sane and give me happiness for a short period as I study but I worry about getting fat again because I used to be obese. I am also paranoid about getting diabetes because I am eating insane amount of sweets.On top of that, my parents won't leave me alone. I just had a huge nervous breakdown when my father kept pushing me for the results of my exam that I don't have. I tell him that I don't know, that it could go either way fail or pass. He pushes, keeps accusing me of lying, then I lie.. telling him how I failed. And then he keeps pushing and asking more even when I tell him to please leave me alone. If I would lock myself, he'd threaten to break down the door like he did before.On top of that, I have to get up early tomorrow to get ready for another exam after today's one but I can't because it doesn't matter that I got all nice and calm, brushed my teeth and masturbated. I had a massive nervous breakdown and now I struggle to go to sleep peacefully.On top of that, I have no one to turn to and talk to after all this. My mother is selfish and when I did choose to turn to her and talk she told me this whole thing is going to give her a heart attack (self centered and trying to emotionally manipulate me into worrying), tries to turn me even further against my father and showed desire to get away from me/stop talking by forcibly ending the conversation when she was comfortable; not me.On top of that, I can't go to kitchen to get sweets to calm my nerves because my father is there and I know he is a piece of shit that can't shut up and resolve some things later, which will turn me into an even shittier mood.I really want to kill myself right now. I really do. I wouldn't even have second thoughts about my parents like some of you because they're pieces of shit and I don't care about ruining their lives. But I won't. I want to live and have the life I dream of and I know that it is possible.

I'm planning yet again another suicide in hopes that this one won't fail again. Ive discussed it with one other person and i leave out the minor details so that they cant stop me when the time comes-but it seems they've discovered a fuck up in my plan. My poison of choice this time is CO poisoning. I baught an old car for this purpose. It's a 1994 cutless supreme. And I rented out a small garage unit for the car and my place of death. I keep the place a secret so that no one can interrupt and lead to another failed attempt. Problem is the car was made into a convertable and has a roll bar. I assumed it would work all the same since the garage unit will fill with CO still. But this person is telling me otherwise-stating I'd die of heat stroke first even though it has a working A.C. And won't explain the reasoning. Are they right or wrong?,1
"I'm posting this here, because I have no one to talk to. That is by design. I have avoidant personality disorder and my version of it is very effective and efficient. I don't know anyone; I isolate myself because I'm ashamed I exist. I was an abused and neglected child, I never received treatment when it might have helped, the person that abused me hid it very well and the other adults in my small family were incompetent and inactive.I started fantasizing about suicide when I was 10; this was triggered by circumstance, not biology. I didn't tell anyone, because it would have resulted in violence and mockery. I have always been desperate for life to end.I tried to kill myself as a teenager, but it was a weak effort and I spent a few months in a locked psychiatric ward. After I got out I went to school for a while, then I just stayed home. I lived as a shut-in for over a decade, spanning my adolescence and early adulthood. It was allowed, I was sick, but no one intervened.I tried to kill myself again, this time violently, again failure. Only a month in a psych ward this time. When I got out, I got my GED, and a job. I tried to pursue normalcy for a few years, but failed. I have never felt comfortable around other people. My brain malfunctions, it feels wrong to be looked at, it feels wrong to communicate. I'm ashamed and embarrassed that I exist.I was left alone with my mother as a child. She was mentally ill, emotionally disturbed, overwhelmed, and unmedicated. She wanted to pretend she was alone. She would beat me, belittle me, and torture me in the hopes of keeping me quiet. I can still see the rage and hatred in her eyes, the disdain and contempt in her voice.She won. I've spent my entire life trying to pretend I'm not here. I wanted to love, to be affectionate, to be outgoing. But I don't want to bother anyone. I don't deserve anything.I'm not dangerous; I've never hurt anyone and have no desire to. That's the worst part, I'm weird and I know people identify me as weird. When you're a man and people identify you as weird, they fear you. I understand, its best to err on the side of caution, but people being afraid of me or thinking I'm potentially dangerous breaks my heart.I'm going to kill myself. The way I see it, I have 2 choices, isolation or death. I can no longer maintain isolation; I'm out of resources, so death it is.To make sure it gets done this time, I have 2 options. If the first is too hard, the second only requires a moment of bravery. It's violent, but guaranteed. Neither option has the potential to harm anyone else.I'm not here for sympathy, just to be heard for a moment. And to let the younger people here know that the sooner you get help, the better your chances of recovery. If you can ask for help, do so. I don't have it in me, but I wish I did.Just remember, there is no cure for mental illness, but there are people that can teach you tools and skills that will help you manage it and gain control.I'm going to die because I see no other choice, if you do see choices, please, make the choice that allows for a better and longer life.I love you.Thank you for reading.TL;DR: I'll be dead soon, do better than me.

"I'm seeing a therapist, I'm on Zoloft and Xanax, and I still want to die.  I have the means and access.  I think about it.  I think it's going to be good for me that I don't have to feel this way anymore.  My wife is supportive, my parents aren't in the picture concerning my emotional well-being, my friends are supportive, but I just want to die.  I want to end it.  I want to have no more of this.  I'm the common thread to all my problems and the one thing I haven't tried yet is removing myself from the equation.  I don't know if I could do it but I wish I could, because even though I've done everything right both in life and in trying to be good about self-care, I just can't stop feeling like I can't do anything good in the long run, I can't help my wife through her medical situations, and I can't hold up the burden of the house nor can I ask her to help because of said medical problems.  I can't logically think of a reason to stop myself, because what people say you're supposed to do just doesn't seem like it's working, and if I tell my therapist or psychiatrist that I'm in crisis, I'm going to have to go through all this again and I don't want to go through it anymore.

"I'm serious about that question. I mean, have you ever just dumped your all into something, only to realise you really just can't do it? I hope you didn't. But I did. Countless times. My whole life, really. It didn't take me long to realise my body is too weak and sluggish for any type of sport. But I kept looking for things to do with my life, over and over. And eventually I found games. Some might have called me an addict, and though I've always denied the possibility, now I'm not so certain. But that's not what this rant is about. I just played video games all day, every day. I sank hundreds of hours in them. Skyrim, Neverwinter, The Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3, Civ 5, Warface, Paladins, Overwatch, League of Legends, and I can continue that list for hours. But no matter how many hours I sank in whatever game, no matter how hard I tried, I always failed. Smite was the prime example. I'm bound to have most of my playtime in that game. And I've been playing and playing, and with every character I failed, and after every match I told myself: ""Hey, that's fine. This match didn't go well. You're not good with this character. Oh well, there are more than 80 in the game, you'll find yours one day."" But now, after match number seventy-thousand-and-something-else I finally gave up. No matter what I do in my life, I fail. I have been useless and depressed for enough years to realise I'm not going to be good at anything, ever. A wise person once told me to not give things your full 100% all the time. ""Keep a steady 75% on. It makes people underestimate you, so you can always impress them when you want. Besides, too much stress isn't good for you. That's why I wouldn't want a job that needs my full 100% all the time. It's way better doing nicely at the 75."" But for that to be true, that 100% needs to even be something. And I can tell you, my 100% is your 2%.
So back to the question in the title. I have tried to do almost everything. And no matter what, I failed miserably. I can't run, I can't lift books, I can't play soccer, I can't play tennis, I can't play FPS games, MOBA's, RTS'ses, I can't write stories, play a piano, or a guitar, anything. So why am I still here? I only KNOW about 5 people, and I'm definitely not ""contributing anything to society"" and I won't be missed by anyone if I go, unlike what all those posts on suicide say. I've been living the same story for years now, and I'm bored. Tired. I don't want to fail for the umpteenth time. So why would a person like me not commit suicide? What the hell is my reason to be here anymore?",1

"I'm sobbing uncontrollably while I write this, attempted to kill myself Sunday night, obviously didn't work. I've been held captive by my suicidal depression since I was 12, I'm 21 now, nearly half my life and the longer this stays with me the less and less I remember life before this disease. I need companionship, female companionship. I have about 3, maybe 4 friends if you really stretch it, none of them women, even though they are the best people I know and they've helped me out through this as best as anyone can be expected to when they hear a close friend wants to kill themselves (I hate making my problems everyone else's.) I need a real relationship, a tender, intimate love to save me from what I've attempted 2-3 times (nothing makes me feel lower than fucking up a suicide attempt,) but I'm so terrified of rejection because I feel like if I keep getting shot down I'll be known as that loser who can't make it with anyone. I don't really have anything in common with anyone my age, I'm a guitarist (who can hardly play the scales or stay in rhythm after playing for 4 years and taking lessons with teachers who've had decades of experience all along the way) who loves 60s-70s psychedelic and blues and jazz music and I fucking loathe today's pussy ""rock"" music and shitty rap that everyone I know adores. I guess you can say I march to the beat of my own drum, but when everyone else in the proverbial drum line is drumming another way and the crowd notices the one rogue drummer, I can't help but feel embarrassed for sticking out like such a weirdo. And because of this I feel like an alien who doesn't belong with the rest of humanity. I could never tell my folks about this because it'd break their hearts, and I just can't see that happen. I'm trapped in a purgatory between wanting to kill myself and feeling selfish knowing I'll leave a void and break my mom and dad's hearts, not wanting anyone to know what's wrong with me and expecting everyone to read my mind and just get it from looking at me. All this is making college impossible, and I'm hesitant to see the school's therapist because I had a friend who went to Northwestern that did the same thing when benzos and coke and alcohol were making him suicidal and the therapist got the cops involved and stuck him in an in-patient facility, called his parents (who had to make the haul from Indiana to Chicago) and he had to drop out. NOT happening, NOT an option, but I need professional help that my parents will have no idea of my seeing.",0

"I'm sorry if this is too long. But if it is, then don't read it!I chose that date because it was 3 weeks and one day after I graduated high school, and clearly anyone who would have missed me after I died would have contacted at some point in that 3 weeks. When that day rolled around, I told myself that if anyone besides my family (who I live with) tries to communicate with me personally (I.e. no group chats) I would call it off. My friend texted me at some point in the afternoon just asking about if a color dye would show up in her hair (don't know why she asked me, I have never dyed my or anyone elses hair). And while it was just a quick interaction, it made me realize that I must be important enough to her.But ever since then I've felt like I'm in limbo, with no real goal. That date was in my head for 10 or so months beforehand, and now I don't have any real end goal in my life. There is a master's program I would like to get into, but that's more than 4 years in the future, and I doubt that I'll get into it; they only accept 20 or so students per year. Since that day, I started going to college. I have yet to make any real friends; I feel like everyone who has been nice to me there so far just feels sorry for me. I honestly feel like I will try again soon. And because of this, it makes me try less in school because I know in the back of my head it won't matter when I'm gone.I don't know what any of you will do with this information. I feel though that posting this might help me in some way relieve some of my inner stress.tl;dr I was going to kill myself this past June and didn't and now I feel like I'm in some sort of limbo.",1

My sibling has been in outpatient therapy for about 5 days and they said yesterday was just a bad day for them. But my mom decided to come home tomorrow bc my sibling is alone at home and ofc she's worried about what they'll do. I understand this and I was the one who actually convinced my mom to go home early bc I want my sibling to be safe. However I really feel kinda upset about her going home early? Growing up my other siblings were always the ones who got all the attention and I was the one left in the dust. I know they're not doing this for attention but I can't help but feel like it's never my turn? I don't want to be like this bc my sibling needs all the support they can get right now. Am I being selfish? ",1

"I'm thirty years old now. I was never one to have many friends. I'm not the type that adds everyone I meet only for five minutes on Facebook so they can show they have over one thousand friends just to elevate their social status. Nobody can possibly be friends with that many people which is why I'm more reasonable and only included those that I've known for years which is under 40 friends. For over a year now nobody has interacted with me on there and I've been active on there almost everyday in some way. I've commented on friend's posts which go unliked or replied to, they don't comment on my posts, and they especially don't return my personal messages. I even invited some out but no replies. My gps was linked on there and one day I went to the emergency room for a accidental overdose. I posted a witty but somewhat serious post on my profile that said something like ""Oops I almost kicked the old bucket. Folks pay attention when taking any medications so as not to overdose like me as it's not pleasant."" And none of my friends committed on that. I know they're active everyday and commenting on other people's posts. It was a few days after that when I returned and logged back in. My point is nobody would know or even care that I was dead, but I'm sure if they somehow found out I had died that they would try to get symphony from other friends about it just so people could focus on themselves. It would be like ""hey you know so and so died?"" Then the other would tell them they are sorry. When in actuality the friend hasn't interacted with me for years. So my point is if they found out they wouldn't actually be upset or sorry I was dead, they would only use it to get symphony for themselves. But it wouldn't even get that far because to them as far as they know I'm already dead. Just some loser that keeps popping up on Facebook's feed. I even phone texted some and they don't return my messages. And I'm not spamming them with texts either if that's what you think. I recently messaged those I had messaged before jokingly asking if they lost their fingers, but no reply and I can see they read it but they choose to ignore me and they all are on messenger a lot. Even the one I considered my best friend and whom I confided in I was feeling suicidal months ago no longer talks to me. And the thing is I truly have little to live for. I'm in a bad situation. I even came out and told them I was a virgin and never actually kissed or been kissed or experienced any kind of love at all because I was feeling suicidal and no longer cared to hide it. We did talk at the time and a few weeks after but we haven't talked for months now or I should say they haven't been interested in talking to me for months now. I guess it's all about social status. People see nobody is commenting, or posting on your Facebook, so they see you don't have any friends so they avoid you. I can't go into my life situation but I assure you I have little to live for, only pets, no gf, or kids, on full disability for physical reasons. So I have everything going against me and nothing for me.",1
"I'm tired of still struggling with my weight. I am very morbidly obese, like hitting the 500 lbs mark. It's the usual cycle of ""I feel bad so I eat which makes me feel worse so I eat etc..."" My weight has just climbed. I've used it to push people away, to bottle up my emotions. When I was 18 I was very close to killing myself but I didn't. Tonight I regret it because then all those years wouldn't have happened and I wouldn't have so much failure on my shoulders. I'm so ashamed of myself that I can't live. I push away my friends because I'm afraid to see that ""damn she's big"" expression on their face. I lost my job last year and I've been afraid to look for one because of how disgusting I look. I went to school to get a better career but my weight poses a serious roadblock. My mom gave me a box of chocolate donuts the other day and it really hurt me. It was a weird reaction I guess. I'm probably reading too much into it but I couldn't help but feel that she's given up on me. I'm fat and a failure so here's some donuts for you. I don't have anyone to dump this on so here I am on the internet to at least vent a bit. Everyone around me seems to have a healthy relationship with their own life, how can I poison it with my crap? Every night I hope my heart gives out and I just never wake up. Believe me, I lift out of my family's life so easily. They'll be sad for a bit but then there'll be a relief that the anchor around their neck is gone. One thing that scares me is surviving my attempt. It would be my luck to end up worse than ever. I have tried to lose weight. Sometimes I feel like a drug addict that's trying to resist their next fix but end up giving in. Why is it that good people die and pieces of shit like me get to live????? Sometimes I wish I'd get mugged so that the decision would be taken out of my hands. I'm so sick of myself and I don't know what to do! I need help to just get through a moment in my skin. I avoid a mirror as much as possible. My sister just had a baby, my first nephew. I envy his clean slate. I'm so twisted in my thinking that sometimes I wish that had been addicted to alcohol or drugs so then at least I would be thin. I'm ashamed sharing that thought it's so stupid. I really don't know why anyone should care but this is my message in a bottle, so to speak. I'm overwhelmed and I don't know what to do anymore.

"I'm ugly. It's my fault that I was born with this face. It's my fault that my parents never gave me an opportunity to do any sport or physical activity and now I'm overweight and ugly too.
It's not my fault that I had the worst time transitioning from childhood to adolescent and no one showed
Me how to take care of my appearance. It's my damn fault that my family treated me like crap and destroyed my self confidence forever. It's my fault that I have to live in a world that feels more like a hunted house to me than a real normal world. Everything triggers me and reminds me of my miserable upbringing and early twenties. I just want to end this. It really sucks also when you knew (with some doubts) all along that your only friend was only interested in sex but then now you know 100% that he is. I was in pain and I didn't have anyone to talk to. No one at all. I only sent him two messages about how frustrated I am with my life and he went off on me talking about how I shouldn't text him to complain. Good relationship and friendships are probably not for people like me ",1

"I'm way too tired to start writing stuff about myself since no one will read it anyways. Basically I hate people. I think everyone's terrible and that no one has any empathy. I shouldn't be upset over something like this. I should get over it. But I can't do it. It's too much for me.So I'll be dead in a few weeks. I don't really care about my family anyways. I've got no friends obviously. I don't even care if anyone will ""miss me"".",1
"I'm wondering if anyone else tends to experience this because I haven't really seen it discussed anywhere before.  Obviously when I'm experiencing particularly strong bouts of depression and feeling hopeless I dwell on thoughts of ending my life.  Outside of that, the rest of the time, though, I still have these like ""impulses"" or ""urges"" that seem completely disconnected from my mood or feelings.  Like, walking across a bridge, not thinking about anything wrong with my life, not experiencing anything that could be related to ""sadness"" or ""unhappiness"" or anything like that, sometimes I can even be really happy or upbeat at the time, but I'll still feel this strong drive or draw towards the water, like a magnetic pull towards the railing.  I ended up moving residences because I had to walk across a bridge to get to work from my old place and I wasn't sure I could trust myself forever.  Likewise with freeways, train platforms, the presence of firearms or strong pills, stuff like that.  I become pre-occupied with their presence and it's hard to concentrate on other things as my mind keeps drifting back towards that ""opportunity"".  It's not like when I'm going through a period of depression where I think about ending my life as an ""escape"" or because ""life isn't worth living"" or anything like that.  It almost feels like I'm considering the act just on it's own, for no reason at all. Just to do it, just because I can. Like the urge to scratch a mosquito bite or step on a sidewalk crack.  Does anyone else experience that?  Does anyone know of any literature or anything like that which speaks on it?     ",1
"I'm worried about my brother. He's 19, my parents kicked him out when he was 18 for stealing their pot and shit so he's technically homeless but he just stays at different friends houses every night, It's no doubt that he's been really depressed but lately it seems to be getting worse and worse, he hasn't really talked to me in months and when i do text him he's really distant. The last time i texted him i asked him why he's so distant with me and he said ""idk i have nothing to talk about, not used to talking to people who listen"". He's always on drugs, he recently tried to quit but gave up after about a week  and my parents aren't even trying to help him out and now he seems more depressed than ever. His friends told me that he's being distant and hasn't replied to them over text in a while. I just don't know what to do. I love him and if anything bad happens to him i don't know what i'll do.

"In a matter of 3 months, I got kicked out from every forum and abandoned by every friend.Up to yesterday I was staff in a website, today I get kicked out and framed. Since I was pissed I deleted some of the files on the FTP but they changed the ip and restored everything. I realized I would have done much more destruction through the admin control panel via FTP but I didn't realize that  until after. I got kicked out from other forums for not taking shit from the staff. For example in one of them, I created something and one of the staff decided to steal it and declare it as his own. That caused me to leak the source code for everyone to use and both me and the mod lost sales. I felt better that he couldn't monetize from that any longer. This led to me being blacklisted from every event the whole staff team would do, or actual staff applications. Another forum incident was, I was selling another one of my programs, of course no license since I'm lazy to add that in. This guy buys it, and shares the license with his friend. Once something went wrong with the program, he , his friend and about 30 more decided to mock me and bring my reputation down. Then he demanded I help him and his friends and I refused due to him breaking my purchase policies. The staff sided with this guy and got me banned for not refunding/fixing his program.For the friend part, I stopped coding and spent most of my time playing games with them ( 3-4 ). In short, I realized that only one really wanted me there and the other 3 preferred to play without me. I like being kind of a leader, saying what to do , what not to do and what I should do instead of them. Such as, let's drop there ( PUBG ) or let me be that character since you don't really know how to use it ( rainbow six siege ). All my online friends found other friends to talk to / play with/ code with. My best friend found a job and is working 8 hours a day and going everywhere without me with minimum contact with me. The only times he invites me out, I actually can't meet him due to me being with my girlfriend ( being the weekends. )Basicly now I have nowhere to go or anything to do rather than code. But what is the point of coding if I can't sell my creations anywhere in their specific famous forums. I go to gym every morning and sleep at 5 am. The only person who ignores my leadership characteristic is my girlfriend and she puts up with all my crap. She basicly is the only person that makes me feel happy and wanted. I don't know why on the contrary everyone else hates me and wants me to be gone. Being hated by everyone means I can't sell my creations or have anything to talk about with anyone. On the forums part I can't let anyone take advantage of me and step on me and control what I do. What is wrong with me in your opinion? I really want to get better and be liked by the majority rather than hated by the majority.",0

"In English class I sit next to a boy I met at the beginning of the school year. We're both 16 and juniors. He's really funny, we talk a lot, and I would consider us class friends. He often says little things like ""kill me,"" and ""I'm going to kill myself"", which alone isn't concerning because some people just say those things randomly. Today he got in trouble for drawing a dick on his desk. We were walking out of class together and he started talking about how he draws dicks everywhere. I half-jokingly said, ""are you okay?"" And he responded ""no I'm not"", also in a joking manner. Then he said he draws dicks everywhere because he ""wants to leave  the school a gift before he kills himself."" He says this all as a joke, but I feel like someone who talks about suicide this often isn't really joking. Some other things about him are
he has ADHD and seems kind of weird if you don't know him. He told me he wasn't going to homecoming (which everyone at my school goes to) and if he did, he would just show up in his pajamas. Sometimes he makes jokes about shooting up the school too. I also like him, and maybe I'm just taking things out of context because I care about him.Are these things a warning signs? I don't have much perspective as Ive never been suicidal or known someone suicidal(to my knowledge). Should I do anything or just ignore it? I don't want to overreact to a joke but I also don't want to regret not doing anything if he hurts himself. ",1

"In march, I almost successfully killed myself. This is grim but the feeling I felt when my body was shutting down was like a relief compared to how I'd been feeling prior. I want everything to end, I've tried to hard to express to the mental health services that I'm a liability to myself and yet I'm STILL forced to wait. I can't wait any more, I think I need to do this. This year has been beyond cruel to me, I lost all my friends, my longtime partner and now am being accused of accusations I don't even want to mention. Being demonized beyond any reconciliation is just... too much. I tried, so hard. I pushed through all these months in hopes things would improve, it didn't. I've never been so alone, it just shows I truly have no place here. And it doesn't stop, it's one thing after another that just breaks me down over and over again... I just want to sleep, forever.
My life is going no where, my efforts are wasted and I lack the ability to form strong bonds with people.I'm going to die alone, how fucking pathetic.

My stress and anxiety levels have been cranked up to the max for so long, I don't remember what happy feels like. My family betrayed me and abandoned me, haven't even bothered to contact me in over a year.I bought a house with my husband, I thought having something to focus on would make me better. It was a terrible idea, the house is so fucked. I think I'm going to go bankrupt trying to fix it.

Ive already injured myself trying to do all the work that needs a team by myself.Basically I feel like I should just give up now. I keep trying and I either fuck it up or get screwed over and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of putting on a happy face, I'm sick of being positive for other people and I'm sick of being in pain all the time.

"It all happened when we were on vacation from college. She had an argument with her mother and her mother took her cellphone, so we weren't able to comunicate. After some days, I thought she was just busy, and only sent her 2 messages. But, after a while, I began to think that she didn't want to talo with me anymore, and I started feeling depressed. I didn't have anyone to talk during vacation, because my best friend was really busy(and she got even busier later, so I just spend all the time I'm not at college in my room), so we didn't talk at all. After a while, I just felt horrible, each day that passed made me wanna die more and more. After some time, she appeared and told me she was without a cellphone, and disappeared again. By the time she told me that, everything had lost its charm to me.
When we returned to college, she was acting really strange, she was ignoring me, and broke up with me. After that, she blocked me on everything.

"It just came spilling out of me one night when talking to my mom. Then I stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when I asked her for advice on something over drinks.

My death wouldn't have been painless for my parents anyway, which is why I've forced myself to live for so long, but now I would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after I told them. I think the problem is that I now feel obligated to improve, and I don't know how to do that. I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now. Changed therapists 3 times now (insurance issues, long story).  The drugs don't work though. And as for the therapy - the simple fact is that you can't decide for someone that their life is worth living. I have been suicidal many times over my life, but they were at emotional crisis points when I hated myself. I don't necessarily hate myself now. I just haven't thought life was worth living for a year now and I still don't. Food is unappetizing. Nothing is funny anymore. I don't get joy from anything.

I think the problem is that I now feel obligated to improve, and I don't know how to do that. I've been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now. Changed therapists 3 times now (insurance issues, long story).  The drugs don't work though. And as for the therapy - the simple fact is that you can't decide for someone that their life is worth living. I have been suicidal many times over my life, but they were at emotional crisis points when I hated myself. I don't necessarily hate myself now. I just haven't thought life was worth living for a year now and I still don't. Food is unappetizing. Nothing is funny anymore. I don't get joy from anything. All that remains is an obligation to others. That's all I have left. ",0

"It's almost comical how I always fail at stuff. It makes me wonder if somehow some god/a higher being/the universe has made a sort of comedy out of my life, like the shows where the character keeps slipping up. I've always fantasized about dying, what it feels like to not be here, and what the world would be like without me. Ever since I was in grade school, I've always wanted death to kiss my life good bye and send me off to whatever's beyond the brick wall. It was a want that gradually grew bigger and bigger until I was crying for release because I was tired of everything repeating itself, of all this darkness and nightmares. I justified my want as something necessary; all I cause was problems and what the world needs less of is me. So I tried, and just like everything else I've tried doing I failed. I've lost count. Somehow even in trying to kill myself I keep failing, another addition to my list of failures. At this rate and luck I'd probably even be most likely to get myself killed by accident (or by some politician's henchmen or maybe a bloodthirsty policeman, one can never tell in this country)It's been 21 whole years of trying and failing, and I think I need rest. A long one. A deep slumber so I could drift away from this world of mine that is slowly tearing and crumbling. I'm planning on trying one more time, December this year, because everything's too heavy for me. Though, I'm really trying my best to reach December since I almost find myself really itching to off myself sooner. (Sorry if this is so badly written.)Before anyone else suggests, yes. I've tried seeking professional help and failed. There's a large stigma when it comes to being mentally ill in my side of the world, plus meds and consultation charges are rocket high. Additionally, I'm a useless NEET and I could really feel my presence being a burden to everyone I interact with.",1

I found something to crave and live for.On my birthday, I went skydiving. And holy shit; I have never felt so alive.The high lasted the whole day. I was just beaming. I haven't felt so amazing in a long time.For all 60 seconds of free fall, I couldn't think about ANYTHING. It was so peaceful. It was like a mental detox.I'm starting my AFF to get my skydiving license this week, and I am so excited. I have dreams now. I think about skydiving all day. I think about how I'll save up for my jumps and equipment. I think about how I'll make a career out of it, or work a career around it.

"It's been years since I felt like I was someone's top priority. I'm 21 years old, in college, should be having the time of my life but it just seems like I don't matter to anyone. Everyone I try to get close to just doesn't show the same concern, the same care back. People I consider my closest friends know I'm in a rut, and yet nobody calls to check on my like I do, nobody seems to wonder if I'm ok or if I need help.My past few girlfriends have legitimately left me for other guys. One texting me as we speak telling me about how she left me because she likes his voice better. Like am I actually that bad of a person that I can be replaced by someone with a better voice? My own family doesn't seem the slightest concerned with me being the way I am. I've tried to talk to them about what I'm struggling with and I get responses like ""You just got to get it together"" and ""It's not that hard to get up and get moving"". I just don't know what's wrong with me that I'm not a priority to anyone. I know that people say there's always someone that cares, and I know that. I just want back what I put out. I want someone to talk to me first, someone to ask me to go somewhere, someone that just wants to be around me because they like to. But I'm not good enough, and I don't know what to change to be that for someone. Anyways today was my breaking point. I don't know how much longer I can do it. I go to work and class with a mask on because everyone wants to be entertained, not stressed by some depressed loner. I'm tired of acting happy.

"It's going to be long. I'm sorry about that... so a little background: We've been friends for about 4 years with its ups and downs but in the end we still stick together. He has had a lot of problems in his life. Living in a poor family, sexual and verbal abuse from colleagues and death of his father to name the most important ones.Recently his girlfriend broke up with him to be with another guy from his class. (Obviously he now hates that guy.) He's had (undocumented but pretty much obvious) depression and suicidal thoughts before that but I think this has been a breaking point for him.After the breakup he's been telling me a lot more than usual about how he feels. Saying that he's never going to find anybody who will love him romantically. That he's given up on talking to new people because everyone who he meets ends up breaking his heart in some way. That he feels alone and basically lacks reason to live plus is overdrien with hatred for that guy.No matter how many times I try telling him that it's not true. That he has people (me and some other friends) who care about him, he doesn't listen to me and just keeps talking about all of this. There has even been instances where he would outwardly tell me his plans on killing himself and i had to talk him out of it.
He would also mention the guy that stole his girlfriend a lot. Talk about how much he hates him, describe how he wants to attack/kill him. Even mention that he's had a dream where he shots him with pleasure. They go to the same school/class so he even stopped attending it because he says he can't stand looking at him and seeing how happy he is.Now the reason I'm writing all of this is because I've tried helping him a lot of times but there's only so much that I can do. I told him that he should see a therapist but he doesn't want to. I try telling him that it's going to be okay and that I will stay with him but he doesn't believe it. He's questioned me a few times. Thinking that I don't actually care about him but I'm still working on proving him otherwise and I think it's slowly succeeding.
But I'll be honest and say that it's really draining me. The way he talks about all of his problems and I can't even help him in any way. Every single time he starts talking about this I feel guilty for not being able to do anything useful.
I'm starting to question this friendship because I love and care about him a lot (not in a romantic way) but the amount of sadness that I get from knowing how he feels just makes me want to stop talking to him sometimes.I realize it's probably selfish of me to say this but really... talking to him when he's like this has been very tiring. I feel like I can't do anything to help him anyway (after all i've tried) so I just end up reading about how he gives himself max 5 years of life because he says that after that he probably won't have the strenght to live anymore, and how he ""puts on a mask"" and pretends to be happy.
It feels like it's too much for me but maybe I'm just the wrong one because he's clearly sick and in a worse situation than me.
So I wanted to know: am I wrong for being tired of it? Should I still be friends with him if it brings me so much pain? I can't just leave him now because he would get even more depressed and suicidal so what should I do?He truly believes that there's no way he could ever feel better or find someone that will love him. He refuses to see a therapist because after his fathers death he doesn't want to ""give his mother any more reasons to worry""
I don't know what to do anymore. Thank you for any help.

"It's my senior year of high school. My boyfriend of a year and I just broke up. My best friend since the second grade hardly hangs out with me anymore. I feel like an outsider in all my classes. Nobody gets me.I kinda just wish I would die. I know this all sounds super petty and like a ""typical teen,"" but it's really how I feel... the only reason I'm staying here is because of my baby niece and my parents. I love them. But that doesn't mean I don't consider running my car off the road on the way to school some days.My recent ex said that I don't have depression, anxiety, ADHD, or Asperger's, despite the fact that I was diagnosed with every single one and have struggled with them my ENTIRE life. He says I'm making excuses for my problems. He told me I need to grow up. What I wanna know is why the FUCK he thinks he knows me better than doctors or even I know myself? Who are you to say that it's all fake? Have you fucking tied a noose and put it around your neck just to see if you had the guts to actually do it? Have you been in my head when I'm going through an episode? Because it's fucking hell, and you have no right to judge. I thought I finally found someone I could trust who wouldn't judge me. I was wrong. How the FUCK could he see the scars on my legs and say it's all just in my head? How the FUCK could he see me break down in tears out of nowhere and say it's all just a lie? Do you know fucking everything? I think not. So how fucking dare you mock my pain in such a way. I'm so goddamn angry.I hate both love and life itself right now. I don't want to be alive. I'd be okay if I fell asleep right now and never woke up. Life is just a meaningless struggle that I have been forced into. My heart is filled with pain and frustration. I must stay to be here for my precious little niece, my very reason for being, but fuck it's hard sometimes.",1

I've been seeing a therapist since March, trying my hardest to be vulnerable more and more, but I still don't feel like she cares about me. The disturbing thing is I do feel attached to her, I feel all the things one would feel when connecting with someone else. Except I don't feel like she cares... not really... no one cares... Why does this matter? Because I want to feel cared about... i want to feel loved... I want to matter to someone...

Idk why i want to die, nothing traumatic has happened to me, but i do, i hate myself so much, ill probably CO myself if this doesnt get better soon.",1
"I've always felt so ""out of place"". I'm not one of those cool kids that everyone loves, I'm that awkward kid that sits at his desk and doesn't do shit in fear of judgement. I'm so worried about what people think about me, it's overtaking my life. I can't do things I'm passionate about in fear of being ""weird"". On top of that I seem to have gotten everything shitty. I'm clumsy as fuck and god has that got me into so many situations. Not only that but I suffer from OCD. Other than that, I'm so fucking shy I can't talk in front of people. Getting called on in class makes my brain shut down, and forces me to seem like a dumbass. My family relationships are breaking apart, me feeling farther and farther away. I don't have people to talk to -- rather I'm to shy to talk to anyone about my problems. I don't give a shit about myself. I don't want to make other people deal with my problems, i dont want other people to care for me, or feel for me. If i get hurt i feel more embarrassed that i got myself hurt than trying to treat myself. I dont care anymore, so whats the point? I dont need a future, i wont matter, i dont need to matter. My life was a mistake and it should stay that way, right? I just want to end it all, no point in keeping on going because I don't have anything to go to. I dont have motivation, goals, anything. The only reason i keep going is because i dont want others to be hurt if i disappear, but what if they dont care? No one likes me, i dount they will care. I have a few friends, but to them im just a side friend. They wont care. My one best friend might care, but he can just replace me. Not like im original in anyway. I dont even know why im posting this. For pity? For hope that somehow i can stop this? I'm going to end it soon, is there a small part of me that doesnt want to? Why does life have to be so complicated. Atleast it will be over soon.",1
"I've always had a ""suicidal"" part of me, since I was a kid. I tried twice, but both times my sister entered the room just in time and went to tell our mother who lost it and called all the ""pros"" there are.I [M30] am now in a not so great relationship which will likely end this year if nothing happens.The worst part with this kind of depression from which I suffer is that I don't know why I feel this way. It's the exact same feeling from when I was in my early teens. It's a feeling of complete loneliness (even though I'm not lonely, I, for now, have a gf and I have my two kids).Is a feeling of not knowing what and if there can be anything done to kill the pain.This feeling is the only one who ever made me consider finishing it all. There's no ""antidote"". I don't know what I want, so it's pretty impossible to find a solution, unless it's final.",0
"I've always had this positive attitude about anything, but now I'm just tired. Tired of life and everything.School is hard. I can't even imagine going through the next three years only to then lose all my friends.Ah. Friends - well I don't have many real friends, a handful to be exact, but that's not the problem, I'm happy with those I have + I get along with many people.Love is my problem. I know, I know. I'll get over her. I've heard that so many times, I'm getting sick of it. You know, I'm in love with one of my real, good friends. But she doesn't like me as much as she likes others. I feel like a second class friend when we're around with other friends of ours. I have oneitis.I'm also very, very ugly and kinda fat. But I'm currently trying to fix the latter so that might not be a problem in a year. Ugliness won't go away. That's also why I won't have a chance with her.And today, I've been at this girl's house with others and I was the last to leave. I couldn't say a word to her. I just said ""Bye"" and left. I hate myself now, can't even talk to a girl.I was alone waiting for the bus in the pouring rain, and there it happened: Why not kill myself here and now? Solves my problems once and for all.Sorry if this isn't the place for this, I'm just scared of what will come next. Will this repeat itself when I'm alone again? Will I eventually attempt suicide? It's the first time I've had this problem and it really scares me.I'm not at risk, just tired and scared. I want my problems solved but I can't do it myself.",1
"I've always hated my life when I was a kid. The worst part was when my parents got divorced. I remember it so clearly. We were at my grandmothers house and they were arguing and my dad locked up my mom in the car so they could talk. But my mom was screaming. Apparently my dad was threatening to take me and my brother in the car and kill the three of us in a carcrash. That's my mothers story so I don't really believe it. My dad would never do such thing, he is a friendly and would harm no one. But whole my life I thought of him as a loser. He accomplished nothing in his life. He cut bonds with his father (I barely knew my grandparents). He got divorced and I only see him once a year now. My mother pisses me off too. Whenever I tell her a secret she tells all her friends or our family. Especially when it's something personal. I had to go to a psychiatrist because I was feeling depressed and I asked her to keep it a secret but she told EVERYONE. This definitely made me lose trust in her. I don't feel like me and her have anything in common. I can't hold a conversation with her because she is pretty dumb and it drives me insane. So I hate both my parents but I love them at the same time. What always bothered me is that they don't even talk to each other anymore. They are too childish to see each other in real life when one of them picks me up at the other parents place. They have been divorced for fucking 15 years... I used to be a very happy kid but I became kind of introverted. I had a lot of dreams and goals in my life but growing up I spent a lot of time playing videogames. I stopped playing baseball and started working out but stopped with that too. I only play videogames now or drink with friends. I worked a few jobs during summer but I quit all of them for my own reasons. My grades were pretty bad in highschool but I still managed to pass. Now I messed up two years in University (I'm 20 years old) and my mom is furious. I understand. She pays for my education and I screw up. But the thing is.. I have no goals in life. I feel depressed and it's hard to stay motivated when I feel this way. When I was 16 I was thinking about suicide everyday but eventually snapped out of it. But now that I failed University, my life has been going downhill and I don't know what to do. I don't want to work some dead ass boring job but at the same time I don't know what I would love to do. My family is ashamed of me. I can see it in my mother her eyes and my mother her boyfriend has 4 daughters. All of them have amazing grades and high studies. My mom always compares me with them and it makes me feel insecure. I know they will accomplish more in life but I don't care at all. I have no fucking emotions and it's killing me. I only feel anger and sadness  towards everything. I don't know what to do with my life... I'm slowly turning into a version of my dad who accomplished nothing and cut bonds with his father. Someone talk to me please.",1
"I've always thought about suicide and thought about how easy it would be to just not exist and when I thought about it it always makes me so scared and emotional but now I'm at peace and I'm calm. I think it's because I'm ready. I think i may actually have to courage now to go through with it. I guess I just kept hoping that eventually I would make friends and people would care about me but I'm a shitty person and people don't like me or care about me. I try to hard to make friends but I can't get anyone to stay because of how annoying I am I guess. My own boyfriend I can't confide in because when I do he doesn't want to deal with my pity party and that I get annoying when I hate on myself. If I can't confide in my own boyfriend, my one friend, who can I. Not to mention he's been ""cheating"" on me, flirting with this other girl, sending nudes, telling her how much he wants her. Makes me feel pretty worthless and unimportant and i already felt that way to start.I feel alone. The most alone I ever felt. Even in High school when I was bullied I had friends. And now, nothing. Writing this is cathartic but I think it's mostly because I think I'll skip The Who goodbyes and suicide note thing. The last thing I need is to be baker acted. I just want it done. I'm stuck at the hospital I work at in Florida because of the hurricane so idk how I can go through with it. I just wish that I had been good enough for someone. Anyone. ",0
"I've always told myself that I wouldn't succumb to my emotions, especially after my brother took his own life a couple of years back. My thoughts on the topic of suicide have gradually grown over time.I'm sustaining myself with a job I've worked for 3 years now and I'm currently enrolled in college. I've had to see every single one of my friends go on to do better things, while I sit here doing the same old shit and have the feeling that I'm not making progress. I lost the best girl I ever had in my life because I let my anxiety get the best of me and ruin the relationship.I tend to talk to myself and sort issues out and I try to tell myself that it's all temporary but I'm starting to lose faith. I found myself today planning it all out in my head while I was at work. I don't know if I'd actually go through with it but I actually thought of ""How?"" and ""When?"" and ""Should I write a note?"".I don't know what's wrong with me and it might just be a phase, but it's getting worse.",1
I've attempted once before and got baker acted and the whole nine yards. Now I'm so broke I can't even afford a therapist and have been having sleepless nights reading different suicide methods/forums. I'm obsessed with it and it has not been leaving my mind for a bit now. I feel like driving my car into a wall 100mph with a blunt in my hand and maybe some psychedelics in my system or some other substances. Hell I might even do it today and not plan much for it because why the fuck not. The fuck should I do? I can't afford getting help and I just keep getting bills after bills I can't ever catch up and pay for things I like... I just feel like I can't be happy. I've always felt this way even when I wasn't struggling financially and when I was well off with a partner too. For some reason it seems no matter my circumstance I just want to be dead. Not awake. Black screen.,1
"I've been considering suicide for so long. It's almost unbearable. Every time I think about it, I always end up chickening out because of the consequences I'd leave behind. Killing myself would have no purpose since everything that's happened to me up to this point is all my fault. I can't handle it, but I can't kill myself. I don't know what to do now.",1
"I've been contemplating suicide since the age of 20, and am 25 in November this year. You can look into my posting history for more info on my situation. Life has improved for me, but I'm not sure I want to stay in this world anyway.Up to recently, the strongest force that was holding me back from committing suicide was the idea that if I die before mum and dad, they'd have to bury me, and man, I'd hate making them go through this... As time went by, however, I became getting number to this concern. Oh, I'll be causing them pain? NO, they caused me lots of pain by bringing me into this world! Oh, they care about me? Well, they don't seem to want to put any effort to keep me alive, why should I put that effort for THEIR pleasure?Same goes to the method of suicide I consider, which is jumping in front of the train. Oh, will it be an inconvenience, perhaps even a traumatic experience to the engineer and the passengers? If they are against assisted suicide, they deserve that inconvenience! If they are for it, my death will be a precedent they can use to advocate for assisted suicide, so I'll help there.So, really. What's there left to stop me?",1
"I've been dealing with depression that's been ignored since I was a child. I've dealt with wanting to slit my throat for years. I have no one, I'm almost positive no one will ever love me, and certain circumstances strongly limit my choices in life and in the future. I don't feel like I can deal with this anymore. I feel trapped in a box so small I cant even move, it's excruciating. I've had so many close calls with suicide recently, I've had the knife up against my throat and I wanted to do it so badly. I don't know what to do anymore, I want to kill myself so much. ",1
"I've been depressed for a few years and I see no hope. My girlfriend is the inly thing stopping me from ending it all because I love her too much to do that to her. But sometimes it isn't enough. I really want to kill myself. I feel empty or I feel completely depressed, but I can't bring myself to do it because I'm too selfish. I just want all the pain to end. ",1
"I've been feeling suicidal since 2012, but I've probably had depression for longer. I tried telling someone about it, and I lost all my friends, I tried applying to disability, and I got denied, even though I have a history of this, documented by doctors. I can't keep a job long enough, I just can't. There's nothing left for me. I just want to make myself bleed and hang myself on a tree. Everyone hates me, or will hate me if they don't already. I just want someone to push me over the edge already. I can't keep this up. It's only going to get worse and I know it.",1
"Ive been fighting and suppressing my feelings for so long and I've turned to alcohol and drugs to cope. The more I do it, the less it numbs me. I'm tired of it. I just want it to end.

"I've been having a really hard time. I am depressed every day. I constantly have this urge to harm myself or kill myself. Now it's to the point where I'm forming visualizations or ideas in my head on how to go about it. My last suicide attempt was in March. I tied a bag around my head. I've seen so many therapists. None of them really helpful except for my current one, who is telling and helping get a better lifestyle. I don't see the point in continuing with her because this doesn't feel like it's helping me and it's really hard for me to open up to anyone in general.

"I've been having fantasies recently about committing suicide in a very public place. The last time I did that was falling onto the Metro tracks, but I was saved at the last minute. But now, I've been thinking about a very public suicide, maybe jumping out of a window of a very busy building into a crowd of people would be a good way to go. I was also considering stabbing myself in a busy shopping area and slowly bleed to death while everyone watches on. if I could get a gun (I can't in the UK) I would shoot myself in the head in the middle of a busy street where everyone can see. I would also try and get run over by a train again and see if I can get run over or maybe stabbed by another person. There is endless amount of ways I could go and leave my shit life! These fantasies have been creeping up in my mind lately as well as in my dreams and it makes me feel that I'm ready to go. My life has been shit for so long that I wish i could end it now, but I would much rather make a spectacle out of it!  I hate my life and I don't want to live anymore, I fucking hate myself, I hate my body, I hate myself for not being as good as I should be, I hate living in a shit place and I hate knowing that my future is fucked already! FUCK MY LIFE, I'm going to kill myself and I don't give a shit what other people think. No one cares about me, neither do you guys, you're just here because you want to make yourself feel good when in reality, you do not care about anyone here whatsoever! This world sucks and I can't wait to leave in the best way possible. ",1
"I've been having intense suicidal thoughts and imagining how people at work and how my friends and parents would react upon finding out I killed myself. I spend a lot of time crying at work hoping no one will notice. I'm going insane, quietly chanting ""I wish I was dead"" at times. Whenever I'm driving or walking down the street, I'm secretly hoping someone will hit me, but only hit me hard enough to kill me - I don't want to be alive with a debilitating injury to make my life even worse. I'm even imagining what I would do before finally pulling the plug. I've been thinking about creating my perfect day - go home to see my parents and my best friends that I rarely get to see since I moved away for my shitty dream-crushing job, go out to my favorite restaurants, plan my last meals. But if my friends are too busy with their successful lives to hang out, I might just stay where I am, go to Red Lobster by myself and get fattened up, then kill myself before the calories can absorb into my body. Since I only see my boyfriend on the weekends and he rarely texts me at all, I can kill myself on a Monday (that way I at least didn't work the whole week for nothing) and he wouldn't even notice something wrong until Friday when I'm not rolling up to his house. Maybe he'd try to call me, but there wouldn't be an answer.",0
"I've been here a little too much for my liking the past few months. But.. I just feel so lonely. It's very on and off, but it's really on right now. Everything.

"I've been listening to that song by Logic, 1-800 blah blah. It's like...the song was written for me. I feel such pain constantly under the surface. Nobody in my family knows about it. I've become very good at hiding my depression out of shame. But sometimes I let little jokes about suicide slip, thankfully people saying 'I'm gonna kill myself' has become mostly a joke, even a meme. As long as I laugh after saying it and say 'just kidding' my family doesn't get concerned.I'm dealing with some shit with my dad, he hates me and has manipulated everyone in my family since we were all born, he has cheated on my mom countless times (as I got older I learned he even gave her STDs from cheating). He makes fun of me for my weight, has told me to stop eating a dozen times. As a result I have gone off the deep end of anorexia a few times. I think the longest I haven't eaten for was a week, but I almost passed out from walking up the stairs so I ate eventually. He just...gets in my head so much and affects me so deeply that I feel like dying.I remember one time I was outside in the garden, sitting on a lawn chair. He told me I shouldn't sit on it because I probably surpassed the weight limit, and I might break it, and it was expensive. When he went inside, I got off and checked the tag. The weight limit was 350 pounds. He really thought I was over that weight. Even as a young kid, he would emotionally abuse me 24/7. I spiraled into self-harm and had 1 suicide attempt, nobody knows about that attempt. The only person I have ever told was my old therapist (who I had to stop seeing because I turned 18 this year, and she only treated youth). My real father figure, my grandfather on my mom's side, died of a heart attack when I was 11 years old. It broke me. He was my best friend. He was more of a father than my actual father was. He hated my dad...he always did...and he did his best to hide that from me, but when I got older and my mom began telling more things my dad had done, I began to realize why.My mom is the only parent I have, as far as I'm concerned. The thought of her dying is making me cry as I'm writing this. I know if she died...I would kill myself. I couldn't live. I think her still being here is the only reason I'm not dead right now. That's really all that's holding me here right now. Aside from that...I'm completely empty on the inside. I just want to die. A couple times I've held a cord in my hand in front of my closet and contemplated tying it up there and hanging myself. I felt so numb, so ready to just...say goodbye. But I can't. Well...I couldn't. Now I don't know.I've been writing my 'will' as I call it for a few months. Every few weeks I will come back to it and add a little more. In it, there's a personal note to important people in my life, from my past and present. Really, its just one giant suicide note. I've been stewing over this for months, really ever since I was 12, but seriously stewing for the last few months. I'm just so lost. This post is a mess. I've been watching 13 reasons why. well, rewatching it. ive read the book too, when it first came out. I feel like...im exactly like Hannah baker. I mean...look at me...nothing nearly as bad has happened to me. ive been sexually abused as a kid, emotionally abused, bullied, all those things. but still not as bad at Hannah in the tv show. I feel so selfish for feeling this way. but I cant help it. I feel like half of the time I'm not even in reality, like other people are more in touch with reality than I am. there are voices in my head, thoughts that come and tell me I'm absolutely idiotic and worthless. ive been having derealization too. I have periods of being happy and 'normal' and then times like this when I'm so suicidal and depressed that I cant even function. I feel like I'm going crazy. and the worst part, I cant even tell anyone about this, because my family will think I really AM crazy...I'm on a gap year right now because I don't know what I want to go to university for. its hard to decide what you want to do with your life when you cant even decide if you wanna be alive. I guess I just...needed to get this out there. I'm so lost in the world, nobody understands me, allllllll my friends from school have lost contact with me since I graduated, they are still in school and I feel like they are alllll having fun without me, acting like I'm not even in the world, not like they paid much attention to me in the first place. I always fade into the background. even in school it was so easy for me to slip out of class halfway through because I'm invisible. that was my catchphrase throughout high school...im invisible. people thought it was a gift, I can skip any class I want and the teacher wont even notice I'm gone. but really...I truly was invisible. nobody could see that I was not okay. not even my closest friends. I was always a quiet kid, never really smiled, never really talked in class, so I think people always assumed I was just a quiet person. but really...99% of the time in class I was trying to keep it together and nto cry. I just don't wanna live. my life has been so bad that I want it to end. I don't even know. just please ",0
I've been lost for a while now... I don't know what to do...

"I've been miserable for the past year. I'm having debilitating diarrhea, loss of appetite, occasional bloody stool, abdominal pain, and weight loss. For the third night this week I awoke due to sudden abdominal pain. The quality of my life is absolute piss.
Parents tell me it's all in my head(also fault of doctor for not taking me seriously) and they won't take me to a doctor and I don't know what to do.
I see no point in continuing to live since symptoms are getting worse and it looks like it could be a long time before I get a correct diagnosis.

"I've been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth  This caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family, and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird, out there, bad, ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me. But I just shrugged it off and kept on going.  Then in middle school I started getting bullied, couldn't walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy. Then I was homeschooled in 7th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit. But I just kept going.And then in 8th grade I went back to school, and finally made friends. People still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me. But I actually made friends.Then in high school everything got better at first, I had tons of friends who I considered family. I wasn't being bullied (to my face). And I was actually happy.Then my second year of high school started and BOOM insomnia. I became extremely irritable, I was sleeping in class, wasn't shaving, dressing like shit and so on. Well I didn't know this at the time but my cyclothymia (""lesser"" version of bipolar disorder) had kicked into 12th gear. What makes matters worse is I was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist. So I was getting medication. But can you guess what meds I was getting? Just anti-depressants. And for those who don't know, ADs + cyclothymia or bipolar disorder = (in my case) hypomania. What fun. Basically for 3 years I was mostly hypomanic. I'm sure you can all guess what this was like.  Well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance, this got mistook for narcissism. And a certain (true narcissist) didn't like this. So he went around to all my friends (who I considered family) and told them I was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me. Which of course I didn't, I saw almost all of them as my equal.  And then it gets better, he decided to assume that I was also a liar because I mentioned that I fell into a firepit when I was a kid and melted my hand together. But there's no scar. So I must be lying. Even tho it did really happen. I'll find a way to prove it to you if you don't believe me. . He told everyone this. So practically overnight my family was gone.  My insomnia had gotten to the point where I was staying awake from 81 straight hours and to cope, I turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep. The fallout is obvious.  So I'm left alone, addicted to xanax, going fucking mad from sleep deprivation, and I dropped out of high school.  9 months later I had a nervous breakdown, cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder. I start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls. Smoking tons of weed to cope. Struggling with xanax and ativan. And I have no one. Not a single person.What's the point. None of you will read this far down my rambling to read this. I ruined everything. But no. I'm apparently not allowed to be happy or have friends. I just ruin everything.",0

I have no idea if he'll take me back because I honestly want to be with him, but I feel like I'm too messed up and toxic for anyone to want to be with.I run away constantly from good things in my life because I'm too scared of the future 'what ifs' of how things can fall apart.I don't know what to do and can feel myself spiraling down.

"I've been suicidal for 7 days and it still hasn't ""passed""",1
"I've been suicidal for a good part of almost ten years now. I always just try to push it out of my mind because I have a little sister who looks up to me and would be devastated, and for my family's sake. Id like to share my story, because time and time again I've been told everything is my fault and I know it's not. But it feels like it is. My cousin raped me when I was 14, I'm 23 now. He stole my innocence from me. He stole any goodness or warmth that was in my heart. Now it's just a black hole that explodes every once in a while. My family split into three sides, the side that blamed me, the side that was neutral and didn't care, and the side that blamed him (which was my parents alone). This happened and I tried to kill myself regularly for months taking pills only to wake up in pools of vomit and feces after sleeping for days, I spent quite a bit of time in psych wards as a minor and then I found drugs, I stopped going to school, never graduated, dabbled in college a little, nothing notable. I did drugs instead. I did every psychedelic I could find to try to alter my mind and not make me think about my death or taking my own life. I also found sex, and to this day I have a problem with sex, drugs, and constant suicidal ideation. I've planned my suicide many ways many times. I have a box full of suicide notes. I fuck random people because it doesn't matter anymore. I had a boyfriend for a while who was really good to me but I still have to fuck things up by having random one night hook ups. What isn't something that people understand is that sex can be a coping mechanism much like drugs and alcohol. I know it's something that shouldn't be forgiven. And I don't know why I keep doing it. I've done it in literally every single relationship I've been in and I don't know how to stop but god I want to stop so badly. Words can't describe. I thought I was with the man I wanted to marry. But I cheated on him three times and I still expect him to take me back and love me which is delusional in itself. Not to mention I'm obviously ridiculously mentally unstable and I'm a ticking time bomb constantly. My life is a fucking mess and has been consistently a mess for the last 10 years and I don't know what to do anymore. Every spare moment is spent crying and thinking of the most painless way to commit suicide and which way would be least traumatic for the person who finds me. What the fuck can I even do anymore.

"I've been suicidal for a long time. I've attempted in the past. Right now I'm going through a hard time trying to take care of a friend who's just getting worse. I want to be able to support them properly, but at the same time I feel like I can't and I want to die, but I don't. I'm trying to reach out to professionals to ask how I could better help my friend during this... I don't know what to do. If I lose my friend then I'm dying too. I won't be able to handle it. ",1
"I've been suicidal for almost 10 years. Finally had the courage to tell my best friend. She was great for a day and now she's acting like I never told her. I can tell we're drifting apart because I'm having a hard time reaching out but every time I want to say something to her I just think ""the person you consider your best friend does not care that you want to kill yourself."" Of course I know that people will be sad after I die. But if they don't care that I'm alive, what's the point in holding out? And how am I supposed to trust anyone else enough to tell them? I get that it's a huge thing to drop on someone, but when I think about it from the other perspective, what I would do if she came to me, I can't imagine not checking up on someone who told me they want to kill themselves. Like all I would need is a simple text, a simple ""how are you?"" Especially when I know they're in an environment with many triggers to their depression and suicidal thoughts. I know people will say ""well they're not very good friends anyway."" But if I can't consider her my best friend, then I really don't think that life is worth living. I'm out of the country and away from my friends and I have plenty of methods at my disposal. I'm going to do it in a way that looks like an accident, because I know she'll feel bad if she knows it's a suicide. I don't want her to feel guilty because I still love her, even though she may not love me the same. ",0
I've been thinking about doing a very public suicide.,1
"I've been thinking about what to say and have been walking around with them half finished for a while now. I'm going to wait a week, and if things don't change, then I'm flying to California. Getting a hotel. And hanging myself. I'm not looking for anyone to try and change my mind. I'm just putting it out in the universe. I wish everyone the best, I wish you all luck in all your choices, I wish I was loved more. I'll post updates about my trip. Hopefully it'll help science or someone else or whatever. ",1
"I've been thinking for a while, watching my life slowly become worse at time goes on. Experiences after experiences lost, activities that seem normal to some just aren't me. I feel like I am living on the side lines of life and I can see the rest of my life too. I'm going to continue paying off debt and working tell im in my 60s. If I can retire, I can't even enjoy my retirement because racking health problems will prevent me from doing that. That is, if I make it to 60. I have a heart condition that has a high chance of preventing me from living past 45. I will indulge in meaningless shit, trying to feel human but can't. I will always be a husk.
I don't want to feel happiness, I don't want to do anything besides die and end this stupid act once and for all. I can feel my mental capacity and motivation dwindling. I wish I could be like the lot of you, I wish I could be normal. I wish reality felt real.  So, one day, maybe a year from now, maybe sooner, I plan to shoot myself, and that will be that. ",1
I've been trying so hard for 8 years now to start feeling better and nothing is working. The last remaining things that make me feel something are fading quickly. I spend all day in the void. There's no way out. I can't carry on like this.,1
"I've been trying to get SSI since 2014 based on my mental health problems, but just got a letter showing the judge denied me. They literally sent me pages and pages of evidence my doctors sent in. I was pretty much denied because I felt well enough to go to an anime convention one time so it means I'm well enough to hold down a full time job. I'm just not really sure what to do at this point. I was hoping to be approved so that I could stop being a burden on the people around me, but that didn't happen. Also once I got approved I planned on coming out to everyone as transgender so that I could avoid being kicked out onto the street for being different than my family. But now that I feel that I can't do that I feel like I have to keep these overwhelming feelings inside for even longer and it makes me feel like shit. So I have no idea where my life is going, I have severe depression/bipolar disorder keeping me from being able to hold down a job and I'm a closeted trans/bi person. Everyday I find myself romanticizing the idea of suicide and how it would be an end to all my problems. I know that it would hurt my family and friends, but I keep getting closer and closer to the point where I don't care anymore. Eventually I feel like I'm going to break and then that will be that. I already have two methods chosen. Either hanging in the woods near my place, or throwing myself over the overpass before or after a doctor's appointment near where my psych doc is located.I'm not sure what I even plan on getting out of this thread. I just need to type stuff right now. Like I've said multiple times, I just don't know what to do anymore. ",0
"I've been unemployed for almost 2 years and I currently live with my parents. I have $600 in overdraft fees that's going to double every 4 days. I have no idea what to do. Last time I tried to kill myself it was when I was 18. I have no friends that i can turn to. The idea of my parents finding me dead breaks my heart. But my depression + this debt is making me lose my mind. To top it all off, I have social anxiety and haven't left my house in about 2 years. I'm going to try to sell some things to see if I can make $600 (on ebay) but I don't think it will be possible in four days. I'm irresponsible and a waste. i plan on writing a suicide letter today and get rid of some personal items tomorrow. On Thursday I'm going to stab myself in the stomach or take a lot of pills. I'm not sure which to do yet. Sorry for spelling and grammar. I'm sure nobody here cares anyways. ",1
I've been watching a few videos over the last week on youtube about how to tie a noose to hang myself. But I'm not sure if I can do it right. I'd prefer just to painlessly over dose on some combination of drugs really. I tried killing myself by eating peanuts because I was allergic to them but it seems I grew out of my allergy because I didn't get a reaction.,1
"I've been watching the show Hannibal recently which I think has sparked some pretty wild dreams... I always have very vivid and realistic dreams but lately they have been about me committing suicide.. And they are very gorey. (Spelling?)I just want it to end.I lost my job in June and have been fucked since. I could ask my family to borrow money but they've already helped so much without me asking that I feel so guilty asking for even $20. I applied to drive for Lyft and all I have to do is the inspection. But my car is out of gas so I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.
What's really been stressing me out is right after I lost my job I got a ticket for marijuana possession in my car. I had a valid doctors recommendation but since I had a bowl packed in my front seat, they gave me a ticket. The reason I was pulled over was for expired registration which I've paid since. I went onto the court website and it told me I qualified to pay the ""fix-it"" portion for the registration. Which I believe is $35. My bank accounts are both overdrawn and I maybe have $0.80 in coins. But otherwise, the ticket said around $1,400. It allowed me to postpone the court date by a month which will now be in a few days. I really don't know what to do and can't really ask my family about it because they don't condone smoking weed.
I know I need to get my original ticket siged to prove my registration is now valid but I still have no way of paying either the fix it portion or the illegal possession portion of the ticket.The only thing keeping me from quitting is my cat. He is my everything. He doesn't get along with anyone but me so I know he would be the most devastated if I left him. I really don't want to leave him but I feel as though there isn't another choice.
I rescued another kitten from the streets that my best friend found. I opened a care credit card to pay for his vet visits. They have been calling every day for the past 2 months asking for payment which I don't have. I put him up for adoption on craigslist because he fights with my other cat constantly which pisses me off to no end. I was looking forward to a few bucks from it to get me started on Lyft so I can maybe start paying things back. But my brothers girlfriend found out and wants to take him for her mom. I feel terrible asking her for money for him so I didn't. She said she will pick him up Friday night. But I really need the money. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to feel. I just feel hopeless and that is it.",1
"I've been writing this in my head and on Reddit everyday for the past few weeks. I always erase it out of fear, but not anymore. And if by any chance, this post breaks the rules, I apologize. With that said, on to my post we go. For starters, I haven't been able to eat all that well these past few days and have gotten quite ill because of that. I actually felt okay during the initial days of my sickness. What I mean is that I didn't actively plan my death as much. I wouldn't mistake that for being happy though. I think it was just the fact that I was too unwell to even get out of bed and I was focusing on being sick.Anyway, I feel as though I need to go through with it today. Does a person typically leave a reason in their note? Well, it's a bit more complicated than that for me. There's not exactly one reason to why I've decided to kill myself,  but I will say that each and every reason is my own fault. No one else's. Nope, it's all my own. However, I will say that when I do die, everything will inherently be so much better for all of my family/pets. No more living off of their hard earned funds and under their safety of their home. No more destroying them with my intolerable and disgusting ways of living. I'm a slob and I mean a true slob. I'm rather unintelligent and unattractive. Short and stubby, overweight, and unimportant perfectly describe me. My own mother didn't want to have me as a child because of all of my faults... I can't say I blame her though. I'm just progressively destroying every relationship with anyone I've ever been close to. I'm so sorry. I've come to decide that killing myself is truthfully my only option. I won't go to therapy as there really isn't anything wrong with me. I'm looking at it from a logical standpoint... Everyone really is better off without me and I shouldn't burden them with my continued existence. I'm younger, I'll admit, but I'm still legally an adult and in the end, it's my choice. This is my only choice. I can't change, I fail every time. Either I'm unbelievably lazy or I simply just can't change. I know I've tried though, but as of late, I've given up. So, I'm going to hang myself. Not this exact moment as I need to relax. I feel like my heart is beating right out of my chest, whether it be from me being sick or not, it's not a nice feeling. Once the feeling subsides, I'm going to go through with my plan. It'll be today though, I'm confident in that. It has to be today. No matter whether I want to die or not. I have to.To all of my family and pets, thank you for everything you've all done for me. I know that I was horrible and I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know that at first, my death won't be easy, but time will pass and you'll see how much better it is for all of you. Even if you can't see it, trust me... It's better. I can't express this enough, everything that's happened isn't your fault and it'll never be your fault. I am so sorry... So sorry. I love you all endlessly. Please forgive me.",1

What size should the cylinder be/ how many litres are necessary?
What specs should I have for the room I'm doing it in (A medium sized garage)?

"I've felt extremely suicidal for months at a time at least four times in my life, to the point where I start making plans, and then it goes away. I guess because it's usually school that triggers it for me, and the semester eventually ends. This has been happening every few years since middle school. Is there something wrong with me? I feel like everyone else can handle the stress by either just doing well or just not caring too much when they fail. I just start digging a hole where I get so behind in every class I can hardly pass them and want another way out. I guess this was a little ranty, but I just wish there was a way to stop feeling so bad all the time. ",1
"I've felt suicidal for as long as I remember but managed to keep a lid on it the past year since I've been busy with school and personal issues. Yesterday, my only friends (and the people I love the most) have told me they want nothing to do with me. No reason for it, either. The love of my life also confessed to loving me back, only to have my drunken mind reject them so they can explore during university and not have to stay tied down for the greatest days of our lives. This turned bad, and now he wont talk to me much anymore.I've been thinking about suicide all night, wrote a note, relapsed a bit and listened to sad songs. Read an inspiring article on why not to commit suicide, but then started to realise that no matter what I do from here on, everything will be for nothing. I can become the best in my profession and become rich, marry the love of my life, meet my best friends and have a great life. But eventually I'll have to die. We all will. Why should I suffer for the next 60+ years just to have it all mean nothing and all end anyway? Nothing means anything, and one day no one will remember my life and everything that I gave a shit about, everything I slaved over, everything I worked hard for. It will all be gone forever. What's the point anymore? I'm probably not going to kill myself tonight, I'm too afraid of the afterlife to go through the process of hanging myself, and I have no other options right now.

So I went there, past 2am, with my rope to end this misery. But upon arriving, I've noticed that the path leading to the place I was heading to was not lit by street lamps. Already gave me a bad vibe, but okay, time to turn on the torchlight on my phone.

Girls all the time say  or  IF THATS FLIPPING TRUE THEN WHY DO YOU STOP TALKING TO ME IN 12 HOURS. Everyone just ghosts on me for no freaking reason. Its so dumb IM SO NICE TO PEOPLE I GIVE THEM EVERYTHING THEY WANT. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE THERE FOR ME NOONE EVER. Why do i feel pain when i smile. Why do i cut and then i smile. Why do i wanna die and see if theres light why do i wanna cry instead of continuing on h this fight. Whats it like to actually have someone in your arms. Im in virginia usa. Im a guy. Everytime i try to seek help all people do are like call these people thry will help. YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT SUICIDE HOTLINE DOES? THEY TRACK UR NUMBER AND SEND POLICE TO YOUR HOUSE. THEN THEY PUT YOU THROUGH ALL THIS SHIT THAT THEN PUTS U IN FUCKING DEBT. How about instead of pushing someone off like that you freaking talk to them yourself. Im bleeding a fucking river here and legit if someone saw me bleedingto death in public theyd probably dial 911 on my phone and then walk away while i was laying there bleeding to death. Thats how fucked up people are. Legit noone out there who gives a fuck about me anymore, so why the hell not end it. I bet anyone who says im here for you will leave within 12 hours. So im not even guna bother. Ill be the one to leave within 12 hours this time",1
"I've lost all hope in living and finding happiness.  I've lost the will to live and i just don't know what to do anymore.  I feel like i'm a waste of life and that i should just kill myself.  Everyone at my school treats me like shit even though i try to be nice to anybody.  Everyone thinks i'm gay (even though i'm not) and constantly calls me a fg or a pussy and always says that i'm a piece of shit.  My therapist has been telling me to separate myself from him (which i did) but he keeps persisting and telling me these things.  He makes my girlfriend cry all the time and calls me a pussy for talking about my feelings.  I feel like an outcast and that nobody will ever understand my struggles.  I've been mentally and physically abused by my step mom over the past 2 years.  I had to run 10 miles from home to get picked up bc she was abusing me.  She abuses my dad too but he still won't leave her.  I haven't seen my dad in 9 months and he's made zero effort to come visit me or see me at all.  The last time I saw him was when i got out of the mental hospital after trying to kill myself and cutting myself like crazy.  He acts like he doesn't care about me.  He never calls or texts me.  I've been doing so good in school and sports lately and everybody continues to tear me down.  And now my girlfriend's mom won't let us be together just bc she doesn't know me and that i'm older.  I want to fall back into old habits and just cut myself until i can't anymore.  I can't take this suffering anymore.  I've had depression since i was 8.  It's been almost ten years with it and it's just gotten worse and worse.  My dad left me when I was 3, i watched my mom almost die when i was 12, i've been separated from all of my family since i was 7.  The abuse, the depression, the meds, the cuts, the blades, the sin.  I'm in so much pain and i just want to rest 6 feet deep.  I'm not going to suffer anymore.  I can't do this anymore...",1
I've lost all my potential. I ruined my own life,1
"I've lost the only person I care about which is my boyfriend and I don't know how to continue on and have motivation to even live. This is the worst day of my life. I won't kill myself because that'll hurt him but I really want to die.
Not existing would ease my pain and I wouldn't have to sit here crying for hours on end. I'm so alone. I wish I knew that the last time I held him would be the last. Would've cherished it more or maybe, actually fixed the situation we're in. I hate myself for bringing him pain.
I could throw up because of how worthless I feel, All I want is him. I'm giving him the time and space to decide if he wants to be with me and if his decision is to never come back, then that's the only way this could get worse. My heart is broken all because of me ruining this relationship. ",1
"I've made it through a lot and I'm really fucking done. At 17 I've been raped, molested by a close family member, survived 2 previous suicide attempts, and destroyed my college chances with drugs and alcohol. I have no one to talk to right now. My ex girlfriend of over two years left me because I was too depressing and since then I've faced nothing but rejection. Someone give me something to live for because I'm drawing a blank. I just want to start over. ",0
"I've never amounted to anything in the 30 years I have been on this planet. I've no friends, no family, and no one who cares about me left. I lost my job and will certainly lose my home soon as well. There's nothing left for me, but to take that lonely plunge off a bridge. Maybe death's icy embrace will finally make me feel comforted.Good bye world. ",1

"I've never been diagnosed with anything other than some panic attack issues years ago caused by some heavy insomnia that placed me in hospital after my heart went crazy after 6 days awake ( that's mostly better now though... I sleep almost every night)But I am just curious are these the kind of mindsets and emotions usually felt by those in depression? I've spoken to people I know who have suffered or do suffer from depression and it doesn't seem to fit how they describe it...Sometimes I get waves of despair and hopelessness, when this happens I literally can't even imagine a future, not even tomorrow... It scares me as my imagination is just taken away and I am trapped in the horrible moment unable to picture anything being better. I mean this literally too, as in my mind is totally unable to picture anything in the future at all...Other times I go numb, there's no emotion, no anything... The first time this happened was when my one of my parents was in hospital after a heart attack when I was 10. I logically without emotion made the decision to kill myself if they died. My other parent was crying, praying, pleading to people meanwhile I just became this emotionless logical creature doing maths puzzles working out how many ceiling tiles made up the ceiling of the hospital etc... My emotions only came back about 24 hours later the next evening when visiting the parent who had been taken into the hospital.I am constantly anxious and scared... A few people have noticed I can be very disconnected and remove myself to situations. I put on a good front but now I'm in my 30s I feel more fragile? In the past few years I've had bouts where I can't get suicide off of my mind, but the guilt of how it would effect my niece is the only thing that's kept me from doing it. I often have dreams of killing myself and seeing how everyone would quickly adapt, accept and be better off without me and these feel like happy dreams.When someone I knew killed themselves earlier this year people adapted and dealt with it so quickly... And I don't let people in as close as he did so they'd be fine if it were me.",1

"I've never been especially motivated (to my repeated peril), but recently (last 4 months or so) I've completely and wholly lost interest in anything and anyone. I feel utterly shattered all the time, and can barely get out of bed, let alone go outside. I spend almost all of my time either sleeping, watching classic films or on the internet, usually drinking at the same time. My family are tolerating it for now but I suspect that they won't forever, and I already find it draining to interact with them on a daily basis. Naturally, I venomously loathe myself for being so useless and passive about everything, and of course all of the usual suspects, no prospects, no experience, no friends (purely thanks to myself) etc, etc. The only occasional bursts of energy are when I spontaneously break something or hurt myself like a child, just as an outlet.
I keep having a recurring dream in which I'm locked in a dark room with only a noose and a chair. I spend a fair amount of my - unlimited - free time researching methods of suicide and am currently deciding between CO and Opiate overdose.The worst part is that i'm painfully aware of how good I have it compared to other people, with parents that would let me just lie about for months whilst barely complaining. It's a horrible feeling hating yourself more than anybody else, and hating the fact that you're too lazy to do anything about it even more.I don't even know why i'm posting this, apart from I feel that I can't go on like this for much longer. Something has to break and I suspect that will be me.",1
I've never been suicidal until now.,1
I've never been this depressed in my life,1
I've never felt more free in my life than knowing I'm going to die tonight.,1
"I've never once seen myself as attractive, and I've never had a girlfriend because of it. I have the weakest jawline and my nose outweighs my forehead as well. I felt like if I got plastic surgery I'd be judged for not loving myself enough. I've thought about ending my life before, I've felt that if I did it would somewhat be better anyways, because of my unattractive mess of a person I am anyways. ",0
i've never wanted to kill myself more EVER then I do right now but i'm DUMB and Im hoping you'd get back together with me again,1
"I've posted here before on other throwaways and idk, I just kinda want someone to talk to? Is that okay? I just feel so numb and drained and just dead. This morning my train almost (and I mean within a foot) hit a truck that tried to go around the gates. My best friend and I got into an argument that has honestly been coming for a while. I feel like I maybe deserved it. I'm not sure if we are even friends anymore. And I have an assignment worth 25% of my grade due tomorrow that I'm not done with. Oh, and I'm having second thoughts about my career choice because it happens every 2 years and this is nearly exactly the 2-year mark from when I decided last time. Maybe if I wasn't such a complete and utter shithead I could have a decent circle of friends and a life. I keep thinking everything is on me, I shouldn't have said that I shouldn't have that opinion, I shouldn't go there,  I should do what my friend wants,  I should keep my mouth shut, agreeing is easier than disagreeing and having lost another friend. What happened to having a conversation about what we disagree over? I'm just so over trying so hard and trying to express myself only to be told I'm a shitty person.",0
"I've recently separated from the military (no deployment) and I've been struggling with the transition back to a normal life. I've been finding it physically difficult to even speak to people. It's not that I don't want to socialize, I know what I want to say in my head but when I try to speak, I can't produce a word. I had to eventually explain through text to my closest friends why I'm so distant and quiet hopingthey'd still stay in my lifecause I know I'm pushing them away. They tell me, ""I understand man I'm here if you need anything"", yet when I need then the most, no response, 12 hours... 2 days... 1 week, obviously they're only there when they're free and feel like dealing with it, when they eventually replied I can't even bother to respond. I get it, it's a shitty spot to put people in when they don't go through it themselves, everyday so black and white, dull and uneventful. I broke and ended up reaching out to a hotline the other day to talk to someone but it brought on more questions. I never really had a plan before I talked to the hotline, the person asked that question a lot, I started to dwell on that question.I now have a plan and a date in mind, not in the immediate future but a date nonetheless. I don't know what my problem is, my life isn't even that difficult compared to other people's stories. I've lost any sort of motivation, everything just pisses me off, I can't even find pleasure in my hobbies anymore. The person on the hotline said it sounds like I lost the will to live. I can't even seek help from the VA since I've never deployed, they see non-combat veterans as low risk and should have no mental issues. Half of me knows something is wrong and is screaming for help, the other half gave up and just wants to push that date up.",0
i've started thinking up a plan. i've started writing letters to people. i don't have anything concrete but it's calming to think that the end is in sight and eventually i will be free,1
"I've struggled with anxiety for much of my life and it has brought me to the edge of suicide on a few occasions. (I never made any actual attempts. I just had very clear plans that I backed out of at the last or nearly last moment.) When I was 16, I thought I wouldn't live to see 20. At 20, I thought I'd be dead by 25. At 25, the age moved back to 30. Now, at 29, I don't expect to kill myself imminently, but I believe it will be how I die. Finally, after 29 years, I realized that my anxiety brings me here. The fear and worry just grips my mind and won't let go. Either I fear so much about what is happening or I worry so much about what will happen, I start to feel as if suicide is the only way to save me from myself. Two weeks ago I almost made this post. I was in a dark place. I held off. Later, I recovered. That lasted about four days. Now I'm back right where I left off. Afraid, worrying, wanting to escape. The last time I had a plan. I planned to jump of a bridge nearby where I live, a bridge that many people have successfully used to kill themselves in the past. Last time I also tried to put my affairs in order before I killed myself. Now, my plan is still valid and my affairs are still in order. I don't think I'll kill myself tonight. I feel I'll kill myself soon. I have often felt that way though. The frequency with which I feel like killing myself makes me not want to seek help for it. Why worry others when I know I won't do it? But I feel like I will do it. Maybe not tonight, but soon. I'm not sure where this post is heading. It would be helpful for me to hear how others deal with suicidal thoughts driven by their own anxiety. Again, I don't want to die. Like many here, I just don't want to live like this. ",1
"I've suffered too much, goodbye.",1

I've tied a noose. It's getting harder and harder resisting the urge to hang it up and get it over with.,1
"I've tried to put what I'm feeling into words but I can't accurately describe what I'm feeling. It's almost 4 AM here, I'm not a native speaker and my mind is muddled by quetiapine but I need to get this ugly thing out of my chest.
Basically, I've been diagnosed with traits of BPD/HPD (not fully developed PDs), I display certain behaviours associated with those personality disorders and I feel like I'm a bad person that deserves to die. I want to gouge my eyes out, tear my body apart and run away from myself. I've been in therapy ever since I was 14 and I've still turned out fucked up, there are tiny improvements but overall, I feel I will never become a person that is worthy of having a happy life and being loved. I mean, all these years of therapy and no significant improvement?
I have a volatile relationship with my parents, especially my mother, I'm a bad daughter and often I think it'd be better for them if I died or killed myself. I  to kill myself if I can't be a good daughter, a good person. I don't even  like a person, I don't feel like a human being and I haven't for a long time, I feel like it's not solid, material things building my body but my self-hate and fear and anger and envy. I'm not even sure I can love, maybe all I can feel when I 'love' is an egocentric, messed up, child-like dependency, maybe that's all I'm capable of. If that's the case, I absolutely do not deserve to have a family that loves me, I don't deserve a life.
I genuinely don't want to die, I don't want to not-exist, it's a scary thought, but I want to and deserve to kill myself. I don't know how to help myself and transform my personality and maladaptive behaviours into something healthy and good and pure. I honestly don't feel like there's an ounce of goodness in me, I'm just a bad person trying but failing to be good. There's not a single fucking redeeming quality about me, except maybe the fact I'm trying to be better but I'm not sure about that because I can't tell if it's not just ego-driven. 
Tbh, I don't even feel I deserve to get better.  I promised myself I wouldn't be dramatic in this post but turns out I'm stuck in my teenage emo phase. Also, I know I'm histrionic but I'm not exaggerating for attention, scout's honour. I just needed to tell someone and I don't feel it's okay to burden my friends with this and I'm ashamed of myself. And I can't text my therapist at 4 AM.tl;dr I want to kill myself both as a punishment and because I can't live with myself. Please someone buy me tickets for a flight to destination Not Me, TIA. I'm exhausted, I need a vacation.",0

After John death, he discovered that the after life, are the real world, and every thing he did in his life, was just a game, and you get a score of how well you use your ""time"" on earth.
When he checked his score, he found that he got a 3.7/10.He checked the ladder boards, and looked for the highest scores.
There were 3 men that got a score above 9, and he found video of the special occasion.
They were Stalin, Roosevelt and HitlerThe judges called Roosevelt, and told him:
""Good job, you changed the world by creating the biggest invasion ever! You get 9.5, you used your time in a great way.""Then they called Stalin:
""Stalin you killed so much people, some hated you some loved you, but every body respected you. You did things that changed the world as we know it, you get 9.5!""Then they called Hitler.
As Hitler come, every body in the room stand up and start clapping with great respect.
The judges, shake his hand, and say:
""You got a 10! because of your actions and life choices this knuckle heads got 9.5!""Hope you like it, I thought about it when I was high.",0

"Just a note I have a cup full of bourbon that I am sipping now. I don't drink normally.A friend I knew for at least 7 years I found out was/is in dire straights. She has been in and out of in patient treatment/ out patient treatment, therapy, psychiatrist. She contacted me about a month ago to visit her at her parents house. I relented and went, she wanted to move back to the major city she was, she moved back to her parents when shit hit the fan. She wanted to go back to life. I tried to help her but I myself have been depressed for many years >15 but I never told her. ~4 years ago though my brother was murdered by a drunk driver. Somehow I survived that to be stronger but I lost my ability to feel and show emotion. I tried to help her because she was in bad shape and felt that if I did not reach out she might actually kill herself. So her mother and I worked out a plan and she moved back. I guess this is important as well. She was in a 3 year relationship with a guy as well but he left her because even he got sick of it. But he still occasionally texts her.I tried to help her as a friend. I did not particularly want to be in a relationship with her but as I spent more and more time I started to feel again and it hit me like a ton of bricks waking up from the stupor that I have been in since my brother died.I stupidly suggested that she go to a indie movie at a film festival with me to try to get her out of the house. When she moved into the large city she became a shut in. Since the place the movie was shown was a few hours away someone suggested that they stay over their place. She started to warm up and started to be the person I remembered her to be. She allowed me to feel happy and she was happy and somehow that's when I started to have feelings for her.She wanted to go visit her mother this labour day weekend and I off handedly said maybe I would go again. She took that as a yes and told her mother before I could take it back. I go up there, she immediately turns sour. She changed, I am not sure. Weirdly I hung out with her mother more while she became reclusive in her bedroom. Her mother had these arts and crafts for her to do but she didn't want to but her mother and I did them while she sulked in her bedroom. She got to a point where we were supposed to head back sunday but she said to me, I think you should go back by yourself and I will stay with my mother. Her mother was telling me to bring her back. She then professes her love for her ex boyfriend when she realizes I started to have feelings because I slipped and mentioned that ""I enjoyed spending time with her"" the day prior.I tried to keep my mouth shut about that and she kept pestering me to say what I was not saying. I kept telling her I would tell her later hoping she would forget. She would stand in front of her doorway not allowing me to leave. I told her after she basically forced me to tell her that I started to have feelings for her. I was going to try and suppress them and really try to get her back to her normal self. This was a problem that I was going to sort out with myself and did not want to burden her from getting better.I just got home from the 4 hour drive from her parent's house. I texted her as she requested when I got home. I said I can't do it anymore and asked her not to contact me again. She tried to but doesn't realize that I already blocked her. I knew I was playing a dangerous game and everyone got burned. I was in an okay spot and she didn't realize she drained me everything. Its been at least 2-3 years since I've had these sw feelings. I am not going to but damn if the ideology looks mighty tempting tonight.Someone please say anything. I know I fucked up too. Someone say I fucked up.",1

"Just in case someone I know personally is reading this I won't use my real name so let's just say that my name is Thomas stevely and I'm from the back end of nowhere in the U.K. I am 17 years old and my recent mistakes have lead to bringing my family a lot of pain due entirely to my own stupidity. All my life all I've wanted is to help people but all I seem to be capable of doing is hurting those closest to me which has lead to me struggling to maintain relationships and friendships. This has lead me down a spiralling path of self harm suicidal thoughts. I don't entirely know why I'm even writing this and I don't see how this will help but many people seem to do this and people I have spoken to on various forums have told me that this can help so here it is I guess. I am pretty much at absolute rock bottom right now and now all I can think of is trying to pay for all the pain I have brought to both friends and family but every time I try to think of ways to pay for the harm I have done throughout my life I keep coming back to the same answer which is committing suicide but I know myself and I know that I'm too much of a snivelling, pathetic coward to actually do it. I know that I should really seek professional help but I don't want to become better or to stop blaming myself because I know that I deserve the pain I'm experiencing and if I get help then I'm not paying for the pain I have brought all I want is to be strong enough to simply end this miserable existence I call a life. I'm sorry if that seemed kind of pathetic or whiny but I've never been very good with words. I'm not sure what good I expect to come from posting this but I felt I needed to get it off my chest.",1

Got a Tinder for kicks and matched with almost nobody, DMs not going well...meanwhile I hear about girls who get 100+ matches easily.  I just don't see the point of life anymore and I want to fucking die because I know that no one will ever love me or even feel any kind of affection for me.  For every girl I like, I'm sure there are 10 hotter guys breathing down her neck.  I'm hopelessly outgunned and outmanned in every aspect of life.  I'm hideous, not particularly smart, not even good at any type of game or competition...my only skill is playing the saxophone but I got so fucking sick of it in high school that I almost stopped.  I don't see why I should live anymore when all I will do is fail and all I will be is inferior.  Want to kill myself but scared to die and scared it will be painful.",1
Just talked to someone that suggested I address my depression and suicidal tendencies up-front with my boss since it all revolves around work and work-related stress.I instantly thought of about a million ways that could backfire and put me in a worse off position but has anyone else tried this? How did it go?,1

"just what the title says. so here goesNot sure what to do anymore. Always been shy. didn't learn how to be responsible, accountable. No study habits. No sense of finance and bills. Parents still paying my bills. I know where to go to seek help, what to do, just not how to ask for help. Failing classes, neglecting academics and career. can't get myself to study even though I have an exam tomorrow which I know i'm probably gonna fail. haven't turned in any assignments yet and they're all more than a week past due date now. don't know how to talk to people, how to communicate. haven't spoken to anyone in class yet, not even the professors. Never had a proper relationship with anyone, no friends let alone a girlfriend or any romantic relationships, never held hands with anyone or kissed anyone, sex is just something other people have that I can't, just like all other human experiences. haven't eaten a proper meal in a month now. Just surviving on water, coffee, bread, milk and alcohol. Smoking a pack a day. Barely sleeping or sleeping too much. No physical exercise or socializing. Just wasting my parents resources and retirement funds. haven't spoken to my sister in over four years now. But she already has a good job and is graduating in spring so i'm happy for her. She means the world to me even though we're not even on speaking terms. Pushing away friends and family. Difficulty in communicating is taking a toll. i'm so behind in all my classes but I can't ask for help from professors because what will they think of a grad student who doesn't spend enough time studying. haven't spoken to anyone in class yet so no study groups either. i'm running out of pain killers that I brought along from back home and I don't know how i'd muster enough confidence to go out and get more by myself. i'm 24, six feet tall but weigh around fifty five kilos. My arms look like spider legs. My acne won't go away and makes my face look like a jackson pollock painting. My hips are hurting most of the time as is my shoulder and my back. I just want to end it all and if that means ending my life then so be it. I know I am going to kill myself. Maybe not now, not today, not this week or even not in the next few years or ten years. But that is how I will end I am sure of it. I smoke in the hopes of getting cancer or a heart attack from clogged arteries. I have no motivation to do anything anymore, no hope for the future, everything seems pointless.Wow, I am one fucked up non functioning non human. To anyone who manages to access this note, just know that this wasn't meant to be found or shared. But if you're here, chances are that you'd have been looking for something like this. And I may not be around anymore. So I can't hide it anymore or ask you to keep this secret, but I request you not to share it.

"Last night, I tried to kill myself. I had been planning to do so for awhile, and finally built up to courage to take the plunge. My method of choice was oxycodone. My mom had a whole bunch from a shoulder surgery that she didn't take, some were 5mg and a few were 10mg.I haven't taken any oxycodone other than when I had my wisdom teeth out 15 years ago, so my tolerance was literally zero. I didn't count how many I took, but based on how many were left vs. how many I had when I started, I believe that I consumed about 65mg in a single dose. I'm not a big guy, about 165lbs or so. I know that people take way more than that throughout a day's doseage, but that's after having built up a solid tolerance, and admittedly I hadn't done much research on how much should've been enough to kill me. But I remembered seeing somewhere that 40mg can be lethal for someone with no tolerance, so I thought it would've been enough since I'm not a very big guy and I didnt really eat anything that day. What I hoped/expected would happen was that I would pass out unconscious and stop breathing. Boy, was I wrong.I simply laid down on my bed, kept my eyes closed and waited to die. I kept thinking about my dogs that I missed so much, and trying to relax and let sleep take me away. But it didn't work out like that. I felt the dizziness kick in, went through periods of profuse sweating all over my body. My whole body became quite itchy. My breathing became very laboured. My heart was pounding uncontrollably. After longer than I expected, I opened my eyes to look at the clock. I couldn't see what time it was, and the blurred light appeared to be bouncing up and down. The slightest movement resulted in the world swirling slowly around me like swinging a cloth underwater. I didn't try to stand, but I know that if I did I would've fallen straight to the floor. I just closed my eyes again and laid there and waited. I'd like to point out that despite all of the physical effects I was feeling, my mind was unaltered throughout this entire process.It turns out I laid there for at least 5 or 6 hours straight, sweating, shaking, dizzy, itchy, taking long deep breaths. It was absolute hell. The whole reason I'm posting this here, is because of one very important part of all of this: You've probably heard that happens before, and I guess it's true. As soon as I realized ""holy shit, I took the pills, this is for real. I've really done it"" I started having 2nd thoughts, and debated picking up the phone and trying to call 911. I didn't, but it made the experience even more gruelling.So all of those hours later, I guess I ended up finally falling asleep, and I woke up feeling like tremendous shit. I  vomit at any point during the experience, which was one thing I was worried about in terms of failing. But I am still dizzy, my legs are wobbly, and I've only briefly left my bed all day. I haven't really eaten much except a couple granola bars, some water, and a cup of coffee.If any of you are thinking about taking pills to end your life, it's not a peaceful pleasant experience. It's an absolute nightmare. I'm still depressed, and I still feel deep down like I want my life to end. I just wanted to share my experience, in case somebody might see it and think twice.",1

"Last week I drove out to a local suspension bridge. It's in the middle of a park which is closed for the season, and doesn't receive a lot of traffic. The bridge itself stands 232 feet above the waters below, which would be ample distance to reach terminal velocity, allowing a quick and certain death. As I looked down to the river below, I thought about just how many people have been where I am. How many of them could use just one person to just listen, not judge or tell them how to ""fix"" their lives. But just listen and allow for them to spill their guts and get that god awful pain out. Somebody that would just make them feel like their pain was legitimate, and not just a problem that could be easily solved. If only someone would just be there.As I started climbing over the railing, and hung with only my own trembling fingers separating me from a release from my own existential hell, I had another thought. I am someone. It made me pause and wonder, What if I could give others what I, myself could never find? Maybe I could do some good in the world after all. I'd have purpose. Meaning. I drove back to town and I promised myself that I would do just that. If I can't express my own misery, I can at least help others with theirs. If any of you want to talk, feel free to message me. I can't promise I can help, but I promise you I will listen, and do all I can to help you feel a little better.",0
"Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, ""Happy Birthday! "", and possibly have a present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids will remember. My kids came in to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, ""Good Morning Boss, Happy Birthday!"" It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock and then Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it's your birthday, let's go out to lunch, just you and me."" I said, ""Thanks Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!"" We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. We dined instead at a little place with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, it's such a beautiful day...We don't need to go back to the office, do we?"" I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" She said, ""Let's go to my apartment."" After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for a moment. I'll be right back."" ""Ok."" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake... Followed by my wife, kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy Birthday"". And I just sat there... On the couch... In my birthday suit.",0
"Lately im asking myself more often and often why do we fear death nowdays? back in the middle ages for example of course, you fear getting in hell and stupid shit like that, but today ? Even if it is completly painless, why would you struggle to just end it all ? I myself am not suicidal i would say, even if i think about it more than often to just quit, go the ""pussy"" but easy way, why should i struggle with life instead of going the easy route ?
personally i think its because mankind fears the unkown.
We dont know whats after death, because none really came back from actual death and reported about it (like actual clinical dead).
But is is really the only reason ?
Like i know im not going to kill myself (yet and it probably stays that way) because im just too much of a pussy to be a ""pussy"" if you get what i mean.
For me its just mindboggling and maybe others of you have some ideas or thoughts about this.",1

"Lately I've been having intrusive thoughts due to an overall sense of being unsatisfied with life, even though from an outsider's perspective I have it pretty good. It's not a typical depressive spell I deal with, more like intense feelings of not feeling content and feeling tired of my current stage in life. Excitement about novelty wears off fast for me. This time though, it's turned dark. Talking to my therapist today about it. It's very irritating and makes me antsy, which is more concerning to me in terms of suicidality. ",1

However, I can't help but think I'll kill myself decades down the line. I'm a freshman, 18,  and I'm planning for my dream job, life, and none of it is too fancy. However I feel like once I've achieved those things and experienced happiness for a time I'll kill myself knowing I pushed past high school and all of life's bullshit for a worthy reward, then game over. It kind of scares me to think that way, but I don't know how to stop it. It's a future problem I guess, but I just don't know. It's all so overwhelming.

"Life is hitting me with waves of shit, but this week I was hit with a damn tsunami.
But let me not say that, because it seems to get worse.I'm so tired. Just tired of everything.When it's looked out of context, it doesn't seem too bad, but hear me out...it won't be that thrilling really, but it's just tiringIt was raining today as I was driving (in my mom's car {important for later}) home, I stopped at the traffic light and this guy behind me in his truck slammed into me. Luckily it wasn't too bad, but I exchanged some details and tried tone up as much as I could because he seemed shady.I insist that we go to the police station to get a case number etc etc. He agrees , and we go. Once we arrive at the police station he begs me to not involve the police because his boss is going to come down on him heavy, and his job is under scrutiny...Now I'm standing there, thinking, the world gives me such shit, and here I have the opportunity to just make this guy's life a little better, maybe safer too because heck, we need our jobs to survive. Yet on the other hand, it's my mother's car, and she would do things the civil way. I choose to take his details and not involve the police because why not, I am trying to be the better/nicer person, coz what you put in is what you get out right?? Not really I guess..I get home , I get a scolding, and I'm an adult, yeah totally normal, coz these things don't happen when people drive behind you in the rain . Gah. Hopefully the insurance sorts this out, but it's going to be a real pain.Fastforward 3 hours of crashing coz it was the only thing I could do while stressed.I can't find my flash drive with all my important documents on. It's these small things that pile up and just beautifully spreads the shit flavored icing on a garbage cake.Night time I'm forced to visit some family with the ugly dent in the car that my parents worked quite hard for, but only to be greeted with a congregation of my family too busy admiring this brand new sports car in the driveway.Who's new car is this? Oh, it's my cousin with the rich parents. So much years younger than me, has had a more blessed life than me.
Then you have to fake smile your way into congratulating him all night and fake admiring what a beautiful car it is. You just don't smile, and you become transparent and they start speaking how jealous you are without saying a word. Amazing how humans are with their interactions. I'm really just tired, but I beat through the night and fake smiled anyways.I should give more context on this said cousin but I'm too tired, so long story short, he is an asshole and we'll leave it at thatNow to think that I am out here reaching, doing what I must, trying to be nice, and life hands you this? Hell, it doesn't even hand it to you? It constantly smacks you with it. Why bother? It's really just all too much. I understand it isn't fair, but rising through this is really tiring. Just tiring.~kinda my second post, I don't know what I'm doing on here or Reddit . So go soft. It feels nice to speak all this out I guessI'm not sure if this even the correct subreddit to post this, but I'll leave it hear anyways",1
Life is just getting me down. Existing is just about all I do. I don't have a job. I only have 2 grand and i live with my parents. I got my associate's degree in visual art and got into a good art school. I decided not to go because I started to feel like art school and art in general was not realistic and pursuing a degree in it felt like bullshit. So now I haven't made art or feel like it's even important. I'm confused as to why I ever thought it was a good idea. I just don't feel interested in it. So now I don't know what to do.  Suicide is always going through my head. I wake up irritated that I'm still alive. I've been in treatment recently for about 6 months for depression and nothing helps. I just don't find any joy in life. I don't know what I'm supposed to do I just don't give a fuck about anything and nothing appeals to me. I feel stupid and boring and confused as to who I really am because I don't enjoy anything. I'm Considering gambling to see if I can just hit it big,1

"Me and my fianc were together for over a year . He was my best friend in the whole world !!!! Everything about him was so beautiful . His eyes, the way he laughed, his humor, even the way he danced silly at clubs. He treated me like a queen at the beginning of our relationship and praised the ground I walked on . Our sex was AMAZING and to this day I have never found someone that knew my body as well as he did. We had the perfect relationship, and our friends envied us because we were so god damn happy . But Overtime, we started to grow apart. We argued like cats and dogs, and he often ignored me toward the end of our relationship. We split about two months ago, and I have been feeling suicidal ever since . I am 25 years old . My entire life I have never met anyone so perfectly compatible for me and I don't think I ever will . My heart feels like it went through a meat grinder, and it's hard to get up in the morning, go to work, get dressed or even breathe . What's worse is that he is happily living his life, not giving two shi*s about me ... so what's the point of living life if you have to live it alone ??.I just want this pain to end . People say I will get through it, but I really just cannot bare this pain I'm feeling . Death would be so great right about now :)",1

I run back to his room where he had cut the top of his wrist several times with a butter knife, nothing major looks like a cat scratches him.I need advice. I have no idea what to do.

My best friend said he doesn't want to speak to me anymore ever. I was in love with my friend and continue to love him very deeply. I was thinking about waiting a couple of months and trying to dm him again but I don't think I can wait that long when I think about him every minute. So I think I want to kill myself and tell him while I do it. Maybe give him some contact information so he can know who to ask if he wants to attend my funeral. I wonder if he'll even read the message. Should I not do this? I really don't see a reason not to. The only times I have ever felt truly happy were the times I was around him. I miss him so much it aches.,0
"My best friend tried to kill himself 3 months ago. He struggles with depression, but, once medicated, can be fine for years on end. He takes breaks from his medication occasionally to prove to himself he doesn't need it to function. It's worked a few times where he's unmedicated for a few years with no problems. This last bout of depression without medication ended with him taking a cocktail of pills. We found him in time, and took him to the ER. The only way for him to be released on his own recognizance, as opposed to being committed to a state run facility, was to go back on medication and follow a strict outpatient program with counseling/therapy.He was doing SO great for a few months! I was super happy! He spoke positively about therapy and really seemed to have a new outlook on life. He's got an incredibly supportive network of friends and family. Lately, he seems to have fallen back into the behavior patterns leading up to the suicide attempt. Isolation, canceling clients at work (self employed small business owner), staying up all night doing cocaine, etc.
I just can't understand why, with all the positive changes he made after his attempt, this is happening again. He's always managed fine on medication previously which makes me wonder if he's even taking it regularly. Long story short, he's pushing me away, and I'm so so worried that another attempt is imminent. I don't know how to handle it or what to say or do. I give him his space and offer to listen if and when he feels like talking. I just feel like it's not enough and I'm scared to death of losing my best friend. Thanks for any advice. ",1

Being told by religious people that the reason I'm still depressed, despite all I prayed and prayed when I was younger, that God is punishing me for something and for not being devoted enough. Fuck that. I'm so done of being a goddamn loser and burden on society . The world will for sure be a better place without me. 11 years of therapy and countless meds, you'd think SOMETHING would have helped. My last relationship disintegrated partly due to my mental illness, partly because I'm ugly and fucking boring. Im such a waste of space. I've been so broken to a point of no return. ",1
"My depression started when i realized what was happening with me during my childhood-highschool period. My parents were always treating me as if i m not capable of doing things or useless thinking they are doing good thing to me. They would presume that i was going to fail or trying to do the work for me. To this day they still treat me like i m useless piece of shit and because of that i had never really tried anything to do to prove them wrong because i dont want to prove anyone wrong about something like that. Recently i ve passed my last exam on my uni. I was doing a project in a programing language, an online shop. My mother was angry on my brother because he didnt do the project for me. When she heard i passed, she couldnt believe it. I have no motivation to be good at anything, ive been brought down so many times. I feel like im alone in this and its really hard when your closest cant give you support you need. They dont trust me and my skills, they keep reminding me of my ""homework"" or anything that i have to do, because they think i m unable to do it by myself, to be responsible for something. The moment i passed my last exam i felt huge depression because i expected atleast from my closest a littlebit of faith in me. I proved them wrong and that i m capable of doing something right but i dont care about that as i already said. I want to prove to myself. And i find my parents attitude extremely distracting and demotivating. Im too scared of failing anymore. I feel like i wouldnt take it good if i failed. I have no selfesteem, no faith in myself. This wouldnt bother me so much if i wasnt actually capable of doing well payed things like programing. Suicide came across my mind because i m scared of ending up with minimal wage job with all the wasted potential. I think i would kill myself if i end up like that. I ve spent my whole life thinking that everyone else was better than me. ",1

"My family is in debt because of my father. He refinanced the house, and used the money for his mistresses (yes, that bastard had more than one mistress at the same time). He passed away last year. He may be dead, but the debt is still yet to be settled.Now here I am, broke, unemployed and a disappointment to my family. I spent my savings on trying to make something of my life with music, where I formed a few bands and hoped to become a full time musician. Alas, none of them worked out, due to the bandmembers either being too playful or no commitment at all.I'm unemployed because I tried to get myself a typical 9-5 job. I did get one, but it only lasted about 5 months, because of how horrible the working environment is, and its messing up my peace of mind.My family was a bit disappointed when I made that decision because I am unable to force myself to work, just for the sake of salary. Sometimes I hate that fact as well. But what can I do, its just my personality, I guess. Now here I am, sitting in front of my computer, with nothing left for me to lose except my life, and pondering on the remains of my enthusiasm towards life.The six strings in my room is probably the only thing that acts as a mental painkiller for me, but I dont even know how long it can last. Its a shame that my country is against euthanasia, else I probably would've resort to that without blinking an eye.Heh........maybe I should borrow some money from my siblings.

My father-in-law committed suicide this morning....,1
"My first idea about whether I wanted to kill myself happened when I was 7 years old. I wanted to die by running in front of a car because I thought I was a bad person and I'd only get worse later on (raised Mormon). Then it returned again in my adolescence. Suicide was always my friend when I was feeling bad at that point. Had my first attempt this year. Now every time I have a bad day or a bad week, or even a bad month, I know how strong our bond was. Like an ex, turned stalker, I am now afraid of what has been my comfort for YEARS. I had no idea how much of my life I've seen it as a comfort, but I think around 12 years. The only time it ever came to my mind as being dangerous was AFTER I had my first attempt. Until that point, I had no idea how strong the urge had become. I was found by a neighbor and haven't checked the medical record yet to see how bad I was, but I was out cold for 3 days. I am still trying hard every day, but some days I wish I could flee my home and live homeless doing whatever I need to do to stay alive. Maybe the hunger would help me contemplate hunger again and this need would fill my very empty void with the feeling of my body needing to live instead.
I don't know how to say this right, but suicide scares the hell out of me, but I feel like maybe life isn't a choice for me and I could let my hungry body find a way for me to survive, instead of my hurt mind. I'm bipolar, had an attempt, and still think of it. It embarrasses me so much when I still think about it even after the first time.",1

I know for sure he's suicidal because I've seen him post something like ""I don't want to live anymore.""What should I do? Edit: Some information you might need to know to understand

I don't have any energy and just wanna quit my job and quit school. The last few years of my life have already been just real dull. The only thing keeping me going is a new girl at work who seems interested in me, but to her I'm just some normal guy she has no idea how depressed I am and I'm scared to get close to her. Imagining her finding out makes me even more scared. Imagining that there's a good chance she won't be around to cheer me up in the future because I'll inevitably ruin things is the worst of all. Without her I really don't know what would motivate me. But she is all I look forward to. Just getting to go to work, see her, and laugh together.

I received a text from someone I hadn't talked to in very long, from someone who I used to half hours-long discussions with, who wanted to know about the world around me, who sent me tea from halfway across the globe. I cried and cried.I've been sabotaging my life for a long while now, and I think this is finally the time. I had an argument with my mother this morning. She told me she'd take away the one thing that makes me feel anything anymore, gaming. She's never allowed me to go out with friends or have them over, always a strict curfew. I made friends online to cope. This year I slowly stopped talking to anyone, and they're moving on with their lives just fine. I've experimented recreating myself every two years, and nothing ever lasts. It's like a cycle that repeats itself every time. Always. For a brief period everything seems good. And then people find out what I'm really like. Arrogant, refusing to accept and be responsible for my mistakes.I've never really talked to anyone before, either, who knows anything about me. My social life is online, and I've harbored many people's suicidal ideations, yet no one I know has followed through, or even attempted. I've lied to every one of these people, of course. Most people thought I was working full time or in university, because I feed half-truths. I did working in a university lab for a year, doing research I never felt was important to pursue. I separated every facet of my life, and allowed no in-betweens.The fact of the matter is that I've always wanted to get away. I left the country to live alone when I was 8 years old, before my mother joined me after a year. Then my sisters came. All of them never liked me. No matter how well I did in school, no matter how many trophies I won, I was still the disagreeable one. I had too much pride, believing my voice was worth getting heard. We had two bedrooms in our apartment here. I got to have one to myself (though it was never mine), because no one wanted to room with me.None of the friends I had ever lasted long. The people who did took different classes than I did. I didn't have any plans for the future. I never had since I was 12, when I first questioned the purpose of living. But the people I knew were different. They had a purpose, they knew what they wanted to do. I never had any of that. I kept winning more and more, but when I stopped, nothing changed. I failed and lost, and nothing changed. I volunteered for kids, and they forgot who I was the moment I skipped a week of volunteer work. It was the hardest part of my life then. I thought with the kids, I had a purpose. I was needed. I smiled through the ghost that I was for them back then. It's all meaningless now. I think I've lived a pretty good life. I was the trophy child, in a magnet school, 1500 SATs, not ugly enough to be ostracized, the picture of politeness and poise to my father's friends. But problematic at home, of course. And my GPA hasn't lived up to par these past couple of years, since it's hard to keep trying. Failing everything, I somehow managed to scrape by and get promoted to the next year. I did find a purpose earlier this year, when I met the girl I loved. I found a dream. I wanted to support her for the rest of my life. But she didn't feel the same way, and dropped me soon enough. I was never important to her like she was to me. And I see that it's going to be the same way over and over from now on. I've traveled, eaten good food. Met a slew of different people from all over the world. My life is pretty much complete. There's nothing I really want to achieve. I don't know what else to live for.Last year I started hallucinating ants. They were my friends. I didn't have many, so they were it. I watched Oldboy a month ago, and a character said you hallucinate ants when you're lonely. They crawl all over my arms, and my legs. I've let my room gone to shit, so sometimes I mix the ones I'm hallucinating with the ones that are actually there. I can't really tell the difference, but they accompany me when I'm numb just the same.The only person who doesn't deserve any of this is my father. He hasn't lived with us going on for 8 years now, and I'm sorry for him. He's worked so hard to support all of us, and he was looking forward to me doing the same thing he did, going to university, and taking up the family business. He gave me food after I slept most of the drugs off today, but he's never known about how suicidal I am. The only one who knows is my mother, and the one time I told her, she told me she'd do it if I did it too. She told me I wasn't special, that anyone could do it.I'm tired. With today, I realized how easy it is. I don't really need a date, the drugs stay in my system for a week, I think. I have two exams over the next two days, both of which I'll flunk, and then I can take the remaining half I have stockpiled. I'm graduating in two weeks, so that's all my responsibilities over. I've researched that it takes up to a week of excruciating pain, and I get jaundiced, but at least it's not messy the same way cutting myself or throwing myself off a building or in front of a car would be. Drowning would be the fastest and least messy option, but I don't think I have the courage to do it. I'm a coward.The fact of the matter is that my mother looks forward to using my room as an office when I've moved out for college. That's the only thing she looks forward to, because otherwise she's told me college is a waste of money on someone like me. It is, probably. I was sitting on the window ledge of the apartment today and she told me to get out of her house and to never ask anything from her again. My father, who flew in for the weekend, waved her away in the way he always does, and took her out to church.I wrote my note and messages to everyone who's showed me the least bit of kindness over my entire life, even though I know no one who will relay it. It's more closure for me. I don't think this is an impulsive decision. I've stuck it out for 6 years, and I'm 18 now. In two days, it'll be my ex's birthday. I get to see her turn 20, and then that's it. I have some prescription stuff to break up the monotony of the over-the-counter painkillers. My liver will fail in a week. I'm finally looking forward to something.To mods, sorry if this violates the pro-suicide post rule, along with explicit discussion of it. For once, I need someone to know what I am, what I've done, without hiding it in lies. Delete this if you will, I'll be deleting myself soon anyway.",0

My inferiority complex towards my boyfriend gives me suicidal thoughts,1
"My initial application was denied. So I'm appealing. But if the appeal doesn't work...my life will probably go to hell. Suicide seems a reasonable option. I just want thoughts/feedback on this.Also: Would including in my appeal a statement like if I don't get SSI, I'm probably going to kill myself help my case or hurt my case? (Would they roll their eyes and ignore it? Consider it manipulative? Deny my appeal and then send me to the psych ward? Or see it as a sign that they were wrong to deny my original application?)I hope this is the right place to post this. If not, let me know.",1
"My lack of knowledge where the heart is made me miss the fatal blow by few inches away. Why didn't they just let me die. I'm sick and tired of people saying i got my life ahead of me and i'm still young and i shouldn't kill myself and i'm just overeacting to a heart break. Well this heart break had just killed me in the inside whats wrong to be completely dead i've got nothing left inside me now. Love is a very Funny because the thing is no matter how hard i tell her that she meant alot to me, how much i tell her i love her, how i would sacrifice everything just to be with her and yet she just look away from it like my feelings doesnt mean anything to her. Its so hard to confess that you love someone that you adore everything about them but its so easy to say no to shot you down just because you missed out certain thing that they want. The feeling of dying seems alot comforting than to live one of more second of my pathetic life. ",1
"My last words before my death,For whoever is interested, I'm sorry.
But you're better off without me.
You'll learn to live without me.
It won't be difficult.
Now, I shall die. ",1

My life ends here and now.,1
"My life gets worse everyday, and everything I try doesn't make anything better. I can't do anything right. All the shit in my life is hemorrhaging and I don't know how much longer I can stay strong. I've tried to kill myself before years ago and swore I'd never try again, but I'm as close as I've ever been before. I have only one friend, and I can't talk to them about it because they'll have my parents intervene and make things worse. I just want to die.",1
my life has lost all meaning,1
"My life has no purpose, I am broke, lonely and miserable. I'm so done.",1
My life honestly doesnt have any meaning anymore. I am a student pilot about 250 hours in towards my 1500 hours needed for an ATP and I literally seem to fail at doing everything but these two tasks in my life. Flying airplane and watching/playing hockey. Every night I just want to die for one reason or another. Another friend abandoning me. Failing with another woman. Fucking up something else up. If I went on a solo tomorrow and I wrecked the airplane I could think of less than 10 people who would actually give a shit and my parents aren't even on that list. Each day is a repeat of the previous. My dad permanantly kicked my out of his house because I bought a hockey jersey he didn't like (T.J. Oshie Team USA to be specific) and my mom won't let me see her without a girlfriend fiance or wife. Honestly everything is in the shitter and my life isn't worth living. My only escapes are flying and watching nhl games or playing in beer league matches but that can only do so much. Do I go to a doctor or one of those people who give a shit? Just end it? Pull a germanwings?,1
My life is a disaster waiting to happen.,1
My life is a joke.,1
my life is a waste,1
My life is at the point where I hate waking up to face another day. it's sad but I hope that I will find out I have a incurable medial problem and it will do what I don't have the stomach for. Finding another person that is actually caring is like finding a buried treasure. My family isn't any better than stranger sometimes always looking out for them selves and secretly talking and why I am like this. Everyone always says get over her why can't you move on life is too short or your not helping yourself. I have social anxiety among other issues but mainly it does have to do with losing the person that helped me thru the day just knowing with her everything was going to be alright. I have no one that actually understands me and my ex is starting to hate me because she wants to not have to worry about helping me any more. I think about how lucky I could be to have something that I can do anything about and it will take my life for me. I would almost feel a sense of relief. I have someone I go and talk to but I can't be honest with him due to not wanting to be committed and further making people think I'm crazy. I am a absolute loser in life with nothing to show for these 30 plus years on this earth. I had someone I took for granted and now I'm alone fighting this battle in my head everyday until I finally just give up. people really complex me how they are so shallow and superficial about things in life. There are very few truly good loving caring people in the world it's crazy.,1

My life is basically over,1
"My life is good and I enjoy it, but I would rather be dead. I am 16, I don't have a job, and I love school. My life isn't bad or hard. Why do I want to die?

I've been couch surfing and my dog, my only source of motivation and love, it's getting to the point where I don't think I can take care of him bc I'm struggling so much.I've PTSD and severe depression.

I've been trying to get a full time, trying to get my own place... but my credit is shitty now and I'm working bullshit part times just to feed myself.I just don't see the point anymore.

I got so depressed today that I social media stalked my ex from 3 years ago (when I was in highschool) and found out she's now engaged. I miss her..she was the only relationship I ever had. Isn't that sad? I don't get sleep at night because my brain doesn't shut off. I'm ruined mentally because of my family problems and I have no solution for it.  My stepmom is suicidal, my sister ran away from home and my dad is about to go to prison for assault. We have no money, no savings and my stepmom is mentally ruined....I don't know why I wrote this out but I thought it would help. I have a migraine Help me",1
"My life up to this point has been miserable, for the most part. I was born with a speech disorder, so I was bullied until about 15. Also, being on the autism spectrem and having  undiagnosed ADHD made my existence almost unbearable.  In addition, my mother most likely had Borderline Personality Disorder and my father, perhaps, had narcissistic personality Disorder, which caused me to parent myself.  I was forced to start working at 11 years old to buy, food, clothing and other necessities. I am now 21 years old attending University and am tired of struggling throughout my existence. Due to being hospitalized during summer and  clinically depressed, I was unable to save up money for housing this semester. Now I have to live at my father's house, which is two hours away by two buses and the train from the University, so a total of four hours everyday. At his house, in addition to the neighborhood being located in an unsafe area, I have to sleep in the car outside, due to a massive bed bug infestation.I was homeless while attending University about two years ago, and lack the will power to do it again.
I applied to campus positions that would have granted house, but, however, did not receive any of the positions. I am currently working weekends and saving up money until I can move out, which would probably three months from now, though that feels like a life time. I realize that life is unfair; however, knowing that life is unfair doesn't do anything to mend my soul. I realize that I must accept my reality as it is and keep on working towards a better future. Ultimately, however, I find it futile to keep on struggling through out my existence, especially for an existence that I ultimately lack control of. Plus, knowing in the grand scheme of things that life is utterly meaningless makes me want to end my suffering even more. ",1

"My teeth are crooked, I have glasses, my face is somewhat disproportionate and all my friends make jokes about my appearance all the time. I haven't had a girlfriend since 2013 and even she was embarrassed to be with me, so much so that she broke up with me by telling one of my friends to inform me of the fact because she didn't want to be seen with me.At this point I don't know what to do, since that time I've had suicidal thoughts but never as much as now, I'm the only one of my friends that is a virgin and it seems like every girl I meet instantly judges me based on my appearance, which I don't even blame them for because I am pretty ugly if I do say so myself.
I love being myself but it seems like nobody else likes it when I am. I'm a musician but all my friends hate my music and my voice which doesn't exactly help my self esteem too much, I'm also unemployed and in every job interview I've gone to the interviewer acts like they aren't going to hire me because I don't look good. I can't even get into the college course I want to take because my math grades are too low because of my stupid dyscalculia math disorder. I also drink and use drugs heavily too attempt to temporarily remove my problems but it seems the things that I do while under the influence always make my friends hate me slightly more, in fact I'm typing this while drunk out of my goddamn mind at almost 6 am at this moment.Honestly I have no idea what to do at this point. I've set a goal for myself that if I'm still a virgin/alone at 21 that I'm just going to kill myself. What's the point of living if only your parents love you and you have no companionship of your own? I don't even have any hopes of having children in the future either.

(Edit: i read it again just now and sobbed, I cant believe I was in that place. The difference between then and now is staggering)I have no idea what to do with it...keep it, burn it, spit on it? Did you guys have notes after an attempt? What did you guys do with it?",1
"My whole life is shit, and it's all due to my pathetic nature.  I've got a chronic illness that makes me miserable.  I've missed so much work due to it and depression I'm likely to lose my job this week.  I have no friends and no one who cares about me.  People only get in contact with me when they need something.  I'm in a large amount of debt, have no college degree, and no career prospects. I've never had a romantic relationship or anything similar.  I look ugly, and even when I was fit I was unable to attract anyone.  People tell me I'm funny and tell me  I'm a nice person, but apparently that hasn't been enough.All all I'm just a waste of space on this Earth and it would be better off without me.  At least then my insurance company won't have to pay an arm and a leg every month for my stupid medicines.  I wish I could fix my life, but deep down I know things would turn out this way anyway, because I'm too pathetic to amount to anything.  I wish I could apologize to the people who expected things from me when I was younger.  Now I'm almost 30 and a complete failure.Every evening I fantasize about killing myself, and every time I get closer to doing it.  Finally I am at the point where I've started planning logistically.  Hopefully I can donate most of my stuff before I bite the bullet.",1
"My whole life seems OK, for the most part.Normal family, good friends, hobbies that I was pretty good at (math, music, programming and IT), nice opportunities for education. I looked good, had no trouble finding a partner. Etc, etc.But because I'm trans, it's all for nothing. I can't live as a guy, and I won't be a woman. I'm huge, deformed by male puberty, my bones are and will always be bones of a man. There are no women with shoulders this broad, ribcage this huge and hips this narrow. I've been on hormones for a long time and they haven't changed a thing. I just can't describe how much pain seeing my body and my face brings me. At this point, suicide seems like a reasonable option if it makes the pain go away.",1

My wife and I separated a while ago and she attempted suicide tonight. Should I tell her parents?,1
"My wife and I split I became very suicidal a month later she came back tells me she was with 3 different people and was off about everything seemed she did love me but she also was lost in her own mind. 3 weeks later she goes and gets a tatoo from a friend I let her go didn't think much of it. She gets home she cries alot tells me she doesn't deserve me  asking me what would completely end are marriage she did this for another week intill we are in the car she says that she loves me more then she has ever loved me and confesses that she slept with the person that gave her a tattoo and was balling hard for hours begging me to stay to talk to her (I didn't say a word or show that I wanted her in my life for hours) finally I say somthing and I don't much remember what I said but it wasn't nice and I wanted to stay at my dad's for awhile she begged me for hours intill I said I wouldn't go. She  cried and cried more for a long time begging me not to leave her and that she felt she fucked up and destroyed the only thing in her life that was worth somthing and begged me not to leave her(I had a very very hard time staying and not leaving) But as the day past I grabbed her hand and she held it as hard as she ever has and still does to this day (this happened 2 months ago and we still are going strong) now she cares about me more then ever always want to be by my side and she has turned back into the wife I remember that would do anything and everything for me and shows it.
Anyways I still want to die I still don't want to live anymore Idk what to do becuz i would never leave her becuz I fear if i did I would kill myself and I know I would i do love her to death but I still want to leave but not leave her while I'm alive I just want to die and I want to tell her that I'm suicidal still but I don't want to hurt her even if she fucked me over and hurt me I'm the type of person that would never hurt anyone and would never do anything to make someone cry so I keep myself alive only for the reason that I won't hurt someone and I don't know how long that will keep up Idk what to do becuz i want to talk to her about me but I feel I can't becuz of that I need advice",0

"normally my pr0n account but people IRL know my main handle so yeah. dunno if this is the place for it though.
ever since middle school i've know something's wrong with me. i try to stay upbeat or appear upbeat but when that breaks or i hit a hard spot i fall pretty hard. i'll end up just sitting there for hours, either doing nothing or crying or some shit. continuing through high school and it's just getting worse. academic pressure is massive here- my parents are immigrants and fought their way up to their current positions. they expect me to excel and i understand that and their reasons. problem is, everything here is a competition. i would bet 80% or more of my school is Asian if that says anything. everyone is trying to outperform each other and it's fucking stressful. and my mindset is to do the same. but i cant- i just can't focus, stick to my goals, i procrastinate etc. since 6th grade i've contemplated suicide several times. the only thing holding me back is my family and the guilt. i've already done a bunch of dumb shit and killing myself would add to the list. i'd be leaving my younger sister behind, my parents, my family. i just can't put them through that. and i fear that when it gets to the point where that doesn't stop me then it's too late. (sorry even I don't know what i'm trying to say... shit)
I don't know. I'm super stressed and not sure if i'm depressed. pretty shaken too, two weeks or so ago  someone I knew killed themselves and this week a close friend since elementary school told me he had depression. i'm just not sure what to do, the help lines help relieve stress and me being depressed for about five minutes before i snap out of that feel good state. they try their best but it always feels distant and robotic to me. can't even talk to my friends because they'll either think i'm bullshitting for attention or report me to the school, the counseling from the school will completely fuck over my grades even more on top of the dozen other activities i have to do every week. I'm not sure what to do. thanks to anyone who read through this jumble. i completely forgot my original point if i had one, but still contemplating killing myself but hopefully the guilt holds me back a little longer. sorry if this isn't quite the theme of the sub but i can't think of anywhere else to get this off my chest.",0
"Not a day goes by where I just wish I was dead.So here's the story...About three months ago, my fianc was killed in a car crash while on a road trip with her dad. She died 2000 miles away from me, and the sonofabitch who killed her is still alive. My life has fallen to absolute hell ever since.She was everything to me. Every single thing I did, I did for her. We'd been together for 15 years. We had plans. We were going to buy a house, finally get married in Hawaii, and start our family. All within the next year or so. She just got her Nursing Degree. High School sweethearts. She's the only woman I've ever been with and happily so. Then some stupid fuck in an over-sized pickup truck plowed its way through her car and three others and took her from me.It should have been me. I'm the one with poor health. I'm the one with a darkness inside him that only she could quell. I'm the one who, if not for her, would probably been in prison by now. She was Good. Capital ""G"". Not an unkind bone in her body. She was a nurse, for fucks sake. She dedicated her life to helping others. I'm sitting here, a next-best-thing-to-sociopathic alcoholic with anger issues who she chose to love. And I'm alive and she's not. What the fuck kinda' universe do we live in where that's the outcome?Now my existence has no purpose. I have no direction. No meaning to my life. The love of my life was taken from me at 29. There's nothing left for me here. She was literally my whole world.So now I'm living with my parents again. Both of them joining my grandpa on the path of senility and/or dementia, not sure which. My dad is slowly losing his once sharp-as-a-tack mind, and my mom is getting more and more loopy by the day. They're all I have. I was never one to have many friends, and my family is tiny, relative to most. Soon I'll have no one.There is literally one person in this world whose presence makes things at least okay for a little while, and she's the busiest person I know. I'm lucky if I get to see her once in three weeks. She's my oldest friend, and she cares for me, but she simply doesn't have time for me. Things are... close to okay, when she's around, but that's... very rare.So here I sit. Her (my late fianc's) family telling me ""You'll always be family to us"" and shit like that, but life goes on for everyone else. I'm stuck in this hell and everyone else gets to just keep living their lives.Think I'll wait until the wrongful death lawsuit is over, then find the guy and kill him. Slowly. Then, either take my own life, or death by cop or inmate. Haven't really figured out the details yet.So yeah. Pretty down. Not seeing a lot of reason to  end it. No light at the end of this tunnel. It's not that I want to die, it's just that every second I live is pure torture. I have to end the pain somehow. I can only think of one way.",1

I don't have rent and todays the last day of the month. On top of that, I need to somehow get another hundred. I have no job, no car, no future. Time is up. There's no way out of this. I've let everyone down. They don't deserve thisI've been put in a psych ward before for suicide plans. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, dermatillomania, and ptsd. I was on medication, but stopped. I used to cut, but was threatened to be sent back if I ever did again. It was the only thing that brought me down though. Now I have nothing. I am not able to find comfort in anything. Things that brought me joy now bring only apathy and dread. I've had therapists. Only one was good, the others were jokes. The only good one worked in the ward and had no outpatient opportunities.I try and have tried to push myself away from it so much, but every day is like a dagger pushing farther and farther in. I have no way out from any of this anymore. Nothing helps. Nothing gets better. I've been battling depression and suicide since I was a child. My boyfriend has a gun. I want to use it. But I can't imagine his pain if he found that I used his gun to end it. He doesn't deserve that. I don't deserve him. I want better for him, I want him to have someone who isn't depressed all the time, who isn't suicidal. I know it must be incredibly stressful for him. If I'm gone, the hurt will only be for a little while. Then he can move to better opportunities. ",0

Everyone Ive met hates me I never had a gf only had like 3 best friends my best friend always treats my like shit and I can't do anything about it and my father was old stingy and simply not fit to be a father same goes for my mother my parents hate me tooI didn't bother telling anyone about this except for an online friend who couldn't do much but tell me to live which isn't such a great advice to someone who's ready to die Ive got it all planned no one will miss me some people will be happy.. I'm gonna drink 6 liters of water (yes that works alot of people died like this and that amount is enough to kill a fully grown adult and my body is small so this is overkill)  Ive already started preparing by drinking 2 liters a day but I'm just afraid of one thingWhat's after death.. Is it the same as before I was born.. Is it gonna be heaven and hell.. Or maybe I'll just be born as another miserable person or animal There's no point in living it's just an endless  loop of pointless survival everyday I wake up telling myself that maybe today is gonna be a good day but I'm always wrong everyday is the same...

"Not sure if its a case of having second thought thats making me write this but i am seriously concidering ending my life, and i dont mean im planning it but rather just doing it. I have a 300ml bottle of liquid morphine next to me along with a full box of slow release morphine. I damaged my spine 4 yrs ago and have been in unbearable pain since.  I also had to undergo major spinal surgery back in feb. But since having the op my pain had trippled and I can no longer bare the pain.  I have been on morphine for the last 3 yrs so im now morphie dependant,  one of the side affects of which is complete lack of sex drive, so that part of the marrage is non existant not to mention that when you try to come off the morphone the withdrawal is hell.  All this has put major strain on my marrage to the extent that my wife doesnt want to be with me anymore and i dont blame her. The only thing that is making me hesitate is my 6 yr old twin boys.  I dont want them to be upset but i am seriously questioning as to weather or not that is a good enough reason to keep me here.  I spend 99% of the day in my bedroom as i can only be in a seated position for so long because of the pain.  Naturally my wife is down stairs most of the time so im alone upstairs,  I have tried to talk to my wife and although she knows it isnt my fault regaurding the spinal injury, I can see in her eyes that this is not the life that she wants. I really just want it to be over and done with, at least when im dead there will be no more pain and my wife can start to love her life.",1

"Now, here's the context:My father was cheating with my mother by talking with a lot of girls on messenger. Aunt found out, told my mother, i dug deeper and found some other things as well. Happened 2 months ago, parents still have huge fights everyday. Now, back then, i loved my father. He's a very hard worker, working from 10 am up to 1-2 am with no breaks. And he still found time to spend with us on weekends. But after we found out, he changed. Bad. He began being cold, ruthless. I already blamed myself for all those fights (since i was the one who introduced my father to messenger), but he threw even more shit at me. Started shouting at me. Everything i did was wrong. Restricted me from the internet and going out with friends. I have to hide my phone every night for fear that he will take it.Before the fights, i was depressed but now i'm depressed to the point of contemplating suicide. I can't bear this anymore. He won't listen when i plead, he won't listen when i scream, he won't listen when i reason, maybe suicide is the only way to show him the effects he has produced on me.",1

I'm trapped, in my house, on computers that I barely understand to do things I'm just barely capable or incapable of doing. Always hanging on by a thread. 24/7.Today feels like a good day to do it. I can't leave my job without being marked a failure, lots of people depend on me as the sole person working on a big project for my company. I can't bear to quit on the spot and be blacklisted from the only job I've ever really held down in my main career field.I'm the bread-winner but my wife wants her job to be more important since it helps her escape me and my depression/anxiety. The world is going to end soon anyways whether it's a super volcano or another world war. At least I lived through some good times.At this point I don't even work, I just stare blankly at my screen, waiting for my time to roll around. Hoping I'll just die to a heart attack from my anxiety so at least I can say I worked myself to death but even that would be a lie. I do nothing, all day every day. Being dead would be better than being a leech on some honest and good company that other people depend on for their livelyhood.My wife doesn't care about how I feel and she knows that I know. She's put herself first, and I get it, I'd do the same. It just feels so horrendously awful that I just want the pain to go away.",0

"Ok, as you can tell by my title I am struggling with life massively at the moment. I have literally nothing going for me, I have spent the last 4 years without any friends, girls despise me and I can't even look at a girl now without getting shot down, I haven't had a relationship in 5 years which just makes me lonely and depressed.I am a 19 year old guy who is on the verge of doing something I might regret. I am currently studying in a nautical college for the merchant navy, I am now about to drop out because I couldn't make friends down here and am struggling massively academically. I have already done a year at college and am on my second year. I have been bullied by a lot of different people at different times so I don't know anymore. I have been to a counsellor before but he made me worse, been to the doctors but they just refered me to a counsellor and won't give me any anti depressants.Sometimes I think why the hell was I even born when I could give my life to someone more deserving of it than me and who would enjoy it more I know I am different, got social anxiety, and a whole host of problems but I pity anyone who goes through this or worse, I cant describe how it feels!Anyway I wish I didn't care about anything as I really want to commit suicide but there are too many things stopping me. What happens if there is a hell which might be worse than earth, will it be painful, mess it will leave on my family, I could be unsuccessful and leave me like a vegetable which would make me hate life even more. I really just wish I could build up the courage to do itAnyway rant over there is a bunch of other problems I have which I haven't covered but I am too tired so just kept it short",1
"Okay, so earlier in the year I posted a question on Reddit about how i was planning on killing myself because i masturbated while my roommate was sleeping. Everyone was really nice and told me not to do it, so I didn't and I deleted the question. However, when I deleted the question, it still kept my responses to comments from people who commented on my original post, and it kept the comments that i replied to. Weeks after I posted my suicidal question, I posted another question about how I was struggling with my friends. I had my phone screen facing up on a table when I was talking with my friends, and when I got a response from someone, it had the username of the commenter as a push notification on my phone. It appeared on my screen.I have OCD, and I was worried that my friend saw the username, looked up the user, and looked up the user's comments on my post. I'm also worried that my friend saw my suicidal post and my response to what the commenters said, and the commenters posts.Why I am worried is because the stuff the commenters said said things like ""don't worry about it man, I had sex with my girlfriend while my cousin was passed out on the next bed! You're normal"" and ""I've done what you done before. I still feel like a terrible person and a pervert, but you were pushed by you're desire to procreate."" I'm worried my friends know what I did or think I did something terrible and extremely perverted. What should I do? I'm thinking I could kill myself to stop living in all this pain and mystery. My friends have still occasionally talked to me this summer (only about twice), but I kinda don't want to be friends with them because they're hyper-masculine and not very inclusive.",1
"Okay...so this is one hell of a story, but it's filled with tons of stuff that will make you go ""What...the...fuck..."" so here it is. Story of my life up until now. Summed up. LolI've always been a liar. From as far back as I can remember I had always lied about who I am, what I have, or what I come from. As a child it was about video game consoles, as a teen it was about my age and my family, and as an adult its become everything. I am a 25 y/o male. My parents are divorced after I had walked in on my father and his brothers wife doing some weird stuff at a family reunion when I was 11. In high school I got my first girlfriend, whom I lied to for three years about my age, and when she found out she kinda went off but decided to stay together for another three years. I was 22 when we broke up due to both of us cheating. After graduating high school my mother told our family that I made it into, and was attending xxx university, when nothing of the sort was happening. I decided to just go along with the lie. Instead I was really just attending community college and failing miserably.After my girlfriend and I broke up at 22, I moved to a new city in which I was now telling my family that I had transferring to xxx university. Not the case. I was attending community college, still, and still failing my classes. Not because of partying and hanging out with friends, but because I wasn't getting out of my bed. Well after a year of being in the new city, I was now 23, my family was expecting me to graduate. So, I ordered and paid for graduation invitations, and when the big day came I explained to my family that I had failed a class my last semester which is why my name wasn't in the graduation pamphlet, but the university was still going to allow me to walk the stage, I just wouldn't be receiving my degree until I completed the class I failed. It's something the university does do, so they bought it.So what I did from here was a combination of luck and also very stupid. I walked down, in the cap and gown I had purchased, snuck into the area where all the graduates were hanging out and waited on the side for someone to lay down their name card so I could steal it. Some girl laid it down, and since I am pretty good looking, I walked over to her and started flirting with her allowing me to pocket her card. After that I went to the restroom. Put the card under water and very gently scratched away her name. I then wrote mine in pencil and went to go stand in line. After this we were all walked out and sat down in front of all the families there to watch their loved ones graduate...including mine.. I ended up walking the stage and when asked about my card, I had said that I accidentally dropped it into the toilet and they bought it. They read my name from the card and I walked the stage. My family and everyone I know has absolutely no idea about the stunt I pulled, why would they?After graduating I got a pretty decent job, lying on my resume about graduating, and worked there for two years. During those two years my mom remarried and my step sister was attending UT and we ended up hooking up and then dating those two years. After the two years of working at my new job I decided to apply, and got picked up, by a new company doing a new job. I was clearly not able to perform the tasks, so after 6 months I was asked to resign.I lost my apartment and everything and have now moved in with my father, unable to get an apartment because I just left my last one. I am now working at another pretty nice paying job, and in a couple of months should be able to get my own place, but I am afraid my life will continue down this road. I am very good at my current job, but I just am not sure if I want to live like this my entire life.I am currently dating a girl who is about to graduate from college and the only reason I am dating her is because she is joining the military which will allow me to live a decent life since she will be an officer. Feeling pretty shitty about the whole thing, and don't really like using people like that, but I don't really see any other option other than to rid everyone from myself or man up and tell everyone the truth and eat that shit sandwich I had made for myself.",1

"One night I decided it was time to die. I've never fit in anywhere, and I've always been a ghost. I never had a friend and I'm not exaggerating. Throughout middle school and high school I kept to myself and I always was an outcast for reasons unbeknownst to me. One night I grew tired of it all and I decided to end my life in 2001. I bought a bundle of heroin, some Klonopin to calm my nerves, and 1.5L of vodka. After downing a significant amount of Vodka and taking the Klonopin, I decided it was time. I injected a lethal dose of heroin - that I'm absolutely sure of. I was also alone -as was usual- so there was no one to save me. I passed out into oblivion. For a brief moment I experienced pure nirvana and peace... I accepted myself for what I was and it was beautiful. I no longer felt the need to connect with others and I was all right with being alone for eternity. Here's where things get strange: The next thing I recall is being put into an ambulance but not in a literal or physical way. I saw it as if I was above myself. I saw the EMT working on me and I recall my family looking on from the window of the ambulance (yes... the stereotypical out-of-body experience and I'm not even religious) . As bizarre as it sounds, I was able to see and experience every emotion of it all. I experienced the sadness of my family, the panic (or perhaps more accurately the intense concentration) of the EMTs because I had no vitals, and the determined nature of the driver to get me to the ER as soon as possible. If I agree with the the story told to me by my family, I was forced into coma for several days in order to let the drugs seep out of my body. When I awoke,  I immediately claimed I was dead and yet my family insisted I wasn't. I had to spend an additional day in the hospital and I NEVER saw a nurse or anyone but my mother. The hospital was quiet and this, in itself, was strange. To anyone who has been in a hospital, there is always a bunch of noise and a nurse routinely checks in on you. Anyhow, the only person I saw during the night was my mother who stayed oddly quiet. The next day I was released and things and people seemed... odd.My opinion is that I died and I don't use this term loosely. I sincerely feel I successfully committed suicide in 2001. Sixteen years later I find that I am still a ghost, only more so. When I'm cutting grass and wave to my neighbors, they don't wave back. I also haven't left my house in sixteen years. After I died (or so I believe), I also came across a mysterious amount of money that has let me become a recluse. Let me rephrase that: I was able to buy a new house in cash -but I grew up insanely poor so this makes no sense- and now I'm kept inside a house that is completely alien to me. I must admit, this all seems too convenient and very bizarre. I can't help but feel I actually died and this may very well be the afterlife. Anyone else in this situation? I haven't ruled out the possibility I have just lost my mind, but I'm absolutely certain everything I have said is true when it comes to the important facts. I even have the hospital receipts to prove it to a point, as well as the mortgage info. The only factor that remains debatable is whether I was actually saved or not. The thing is, the events that transpired in me being saved make absolutely no sense. I was absolutely certain to make sure I would die that night and my family wasn't around to help me. However, my brother claims he randomly stumbled across me and saw that I wasn't breathing which is completely out of character (he wasn't even near the area I OD'd in). It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I can't help but feel my psyche is some how attempting to cope with my death. Even more disturbing is the events after the attempt, my father suddenly claimed he forgot about a pension and then gave me enough money to buy a home and live in absolute seclusion. I grew up INSANELY poor and prior to my suicide I struggled to find food and merely survive. Now he suddenly comes across a TON of money I'm living a comfortable life in absolute seclusion. To sum it up: After I ""attempted"" suicide the events that transpired make absolutely no sense whatsoever. I can't help but feel I successfully committed suicide in 2001. The depressing shit is I'm not happy and I routinely find myself considering suicide. While I'm now in a good home and living comfortably, my families health is quickly deteriorating. Its as if I'm being forced to witness my only remaining connection to this world die off and its absolutely terrifying.Needless to say, I can't help but wonder whether I'm losing my mind. Regardless, I find myself routinely contemplating suicide to test the theory that I'm already dead. Anyhow, I realize this post may sound absurd and I totally understand if its deleted for being off-topic or outright ignored (the latter of which will make sense).",1

"Over the past three days, I have gone from flying high with happiness to sitting on my bathroom floor for hours with a knife in hand trying to come up with reasons not to end it there and then. Each day began with an overwhelming sense of worthlessness and loneliness that stems from years by myself. Since freshman year of college, I have lacked a true best friend and have repeatedly failed to make the jump from friends to being in a relationship. Most recently, those attempts have been complicated by having a close friend chosen over me. These have strained my friendships from a personal perspective though until recently I did my best to hide my feelings of jealousy and depression. This most recent incident led to a full mental breakdown as my closest friend and confidant was the culprit. The only person who I have been able to talk to in recent memory and here I sit wanting to hate his guts, yet rely on him to prevent me from doing something truly stupid. In addition to having one close confidant I have self-medicated heavily with alcohol for years and marijuana for months to simply allow me to sleep at night. Neither being solutions, my sincere desire to be loved and wanted has grown into an immense and impassable wall that will not let me go on.When graduating college, I was able to keep my spirits up by telling myself in graduate school it would be different, that I would find someone who cared. It is now the start of my fifth year of graduate school, and despite having more friends at one time than ever before, I feel more alone than ever before. I come home from work and never have a real conversation until two weeks ago. A new student began texting me on a regular basis and we seemed to be pretty compatible. She enjoyed activities that I enjoyed and we seemed to be getting along well. My close friend returns from a conference and she goes back to swooning over him, despite that he was seeing another girl. Nonetheless, they grow close and she virtually stops talking to me dropping the proverbial floor out from under me. Finally, on Thursday night it hits me. In the middle of a pick-up volleyball game with her, I realize that I do not want to be there or anywhere. I suddenly have an overwhelming desire to cry and cannot think straight. So naturally, I leave immediately, walk home alone as usual, and have a breakdown for about an hour. When I cannot take it anymore I go over and smoke with a few friends, but toward the end of the session I begin to feel the anxiety and loneliness creeping in and immediately leave. Barely sleeping, I go to work Friday morning and take care of what I need to do and leave by noon as I cannot talk to either my confidant or the girl. I proceed to go home and cry and lay down attempting to let the feelings pass, but dwelling on the simple fact that I must be outright undesirable. After all, it's been eight years, in the words of George Constanza, I'm the king of it's not you, it's me! Most of Friday afternoon, I begin to feel that suicide is the only option to truly make things better. Dwelling on all of the failed infatuations I have had over the years and the numerous times that I watch my crush fall into a relationship with someone else. By early evening I stabilize, smoke and decide to go to our mutual friend's pregame and club night. High as a kite, I am content with the world and able to deal with everything well surrounded by friends. We arrive at the club, and I am already uncomfortable with being forced to dance as I have really bad social anxiety, but I am trying to deal with it as everyone else seems to be enjoying themselves. I start to come down and realize that I can no longer be there and decide to leave, my confidant stops me on the way out making me promise to not kill myself and to meet him for lunch tomorrow. Little does he know that he is part of the reason I feel this way. Saturday hits, I barely slept, and go to my car service appointment feeling decently well. Then I go to work and see my confidant, and lose it. I immediately drop back into the jealousy and hatred. I go home and sit on my bathroom floor with a knife in hand for about an hour. I test the blade against my skin and really just wondering if it will truly be better or whether I have a chance to turn my life around. Maybe I can attempt it and it will act as a call for help. My confidant asks how it is going over text, and I respond that today is worse than yesterday as it was. He urges me to get help, but coming from the person that I feel most betrayed by makes me even angrier. I order shitty chinese food, which normally I would devour, but eat less than a quarter of it. I am disgusted with myself for ordering it in the first place. I move between video games, attempting to sleep, and watching TV for hours. Finally decide to go to work, finish prepping for my trip that starts the next day. Spend about three hours attempting to stabilize hoping that my confidant comes over to talk, but at the same time even seeing him makes my blood boil. I walk home and see my bike had been stolen from my apartment building. I am completely apathetic toward the feeling of being violated by some random stranger. I sink into a chair and sit there staring out the window for what felt like an eternity, texting my confidant and my crush. Both stop texting me around the same time, I get high and go to sleep.Getting up well before the crack of dawn getting less than five hours of sleep for a fourth night in a row. I feel like garbage and go through episodes of anger and sadness. I wonder if I should just kill myself and avoid the next week of seclusion and loneliness on the trip I have to a laboratory. I drive to my Dad's house and here I sit wondering whether I will make it through the week. I took a nap and realized I need to take the toxic relationships out of my life including - my crush, my confidant, a previous crush and another close friend, and then one friend who is just an asshole. On top of these changes, I need to stop self medicating and go get real help. I keep having to stop myself from relapsing back into the thoughts of hate, but also how rid myself of even these toxic relationships will only remove roughly half of my close friends further complicating the problem.

"Over the past three days, I have gone from flying high with happiness to sitting on my bathroom floor for hours with a knife in hand trying to come up with reasons not to end it there and then. Each day began with an overwhelming sense of worthlessness and loneliness that stems from years by myself. Since freshman year of college, I have lacked a true best friend and have repeatedly failed to make the jump from friends to being in a relationship. Most recently, those attempts have been complicated by having a close friend chosen over me. These have strained my friendships from a personal perspective though until recently I did my best to hide my feelings of jealousy and depression. This most recent incident led to a full mental breakdown as my closest friend and confidant was the culprit. The only person who I have been able to talk to in recent memory and here I sit wanting to hate his guts, yet rely on him to prevent me from doing something truly stupid. In addition to having one close confidant I have self-medicated heavily with alcohol for years and marijuana for months to simply allow me to sleep at night. Neither being solutions, my sincere desire to be loved and wanted has grown into an immense and impassable wall that will not let me go on.When graduating college, I was able to keep my spirits up by telling myself in graduate school it would be different, that I would find someone who cared. It is now the start of my fifth year of graduate school, and despite having more friends at one time than ever before, I feel more alone than ever before. I come home from work and never have a real conversation until two weeks ago. A new student began texting me on a regular basis and we seemed to be pretty compatible. She enjoyed activities that I enjoyed and we seemed to be getting along well. My close friend returns from a conference and she goes back to swooning over him, despite that he was seeing another girl. Nonetheless, they grow close and she virtually stops talking to me dropping the proverbial floor out from under me. Finally, on Thursday night it hits me. In the middle of a pick-up volleyball game with her, I realize that I do not want to be there or anywhere. I suddenly have an overwhelming desire to cry and cannot think straight. So naturally, I leave immediately, walk home alone as usual, and have a breakdown for about an hour. When I cannot take it anymore I go over and smoke with a few friends, but toward the end of the session I begin to feel the anxiety and loneliness creeping in and immediately leave. Barely sleeping, I go to work Friday morning and take care of what I need to do and leave by noon as I cannot talk to either my confidant or the girl. I proceed to go home and cry and lay down attempting to let the feelings pass, but dwelling on the simple fact that I must be outright undesirable. After all, it's been eight years, in the words of George Constanza, I'm the king of it's not you, it's me! Most of Friday afternoon, I begin to feel that suicide is the only option to truly make things better. Dwelling on all of the failed infatuations I have had over the years and the numerous times that I watch my crush fall into a relationship with someone else. By early evening I stabilize, smoke and decide to go to our mutual friend's pregame and club night. High as a kite, I am content with the world and able to deal with everything well surrounded by friends. We arrive at the club, and I am already uncomfortable with being forced to dance as I have really bad social anxiety, but I am trying to deal with it as everyone else seems to be enjoying themselves. I start to come down and realize that I can no longer be there and decide to leave, my confidant stops me on the way out making me promise to not kill myself and to meet him for lunch tomorrow. Little does he know that he is part of the reason I feel this way. Saturday hits, I barely slept, and go to my car service appointment feeling decently well. Then I go to work and see my confidant, and lose it. I immediately drop back into the jealousy and hatred. I go home and sit on my bathroom floor with a knife in hand for about an hour. I test the blade against my skin and really just wondering if it will truly be better or whether I have a chance to turn my life around. Maybe I can attempt it and it will act as a call for help. My confidant asks how it is going over text, and I respond that today is worse than yesterday as it was. He urges me to get help, but coming from the person that I feel most betrayed by makes me even angrier. I order shitty chinese food, which normally I would devour, but eat less than a quarter of it. I am disgusted with myself for ordering it in the first place. I move between video games, attempting to sleep, and watching TV for hours. Finally decide to go to work, finish prepping for my trip that starts the next day. Spend about three hours attempting to stabilize hoping that my confidant comes over to talk, but at the same time even seeing him makes my blood boil. I walk home and see my bike had been stolen from my apartment building. I am completely apathetic toward the feeling of being violated by some random stranger. I sink into a chair and sit there staring out the window for what felt like an eternity, texting my confidant and my crush. Both stop texting me around the same time, I get high and go to sleep.Getting up well before the crack of dawn getting less than five hours of sleep for a fourth night in a row. I feel like garbage and go through episodes of anger and sadness. I wonder if I should just kill myself and avoid the next week of seclusion and loneliness on the trip I have to a laboratory. I drive to my Dad's house and here I sit wondering whether I will make it through the week. I took a nap and realized I need to take the toxic relationships out of my life including - my crush, my confidant, a previous crush and another close friend, and then one friend who is just an asshole. On top of these changes, I need to stop self medicating and go get real help. I keep having to stop myself from relapsing back into the thoughts of hate, but also how rid myself of even these toxic relationships will only remove roughly half of my close friends further complicating the problem. I am really scared that being alone with my thoughts for the next 8 days is a dangerous situation. I have no way out without risking my career, but I am risking my life. I really do not know what to do because there is no way to get out of this commitment. At the same, time I no longer have any hope that I will find someone in graduate school, and then I will move onto a post doc where I am in another temporary position where I will not know anyone to start.

Paranoia over past events making me suicidal,1
"Part of what I write may seem far-fetched but it's very real and it's a crippling issue for me.I'm 19 and in college. I've had a very mediocre and unfulfilling social life, and almost since elementary I can recall always feeling lonely. This in turn caused me to be very shy around anyone I didn't know so I would stay cooped up at home playing video games. By high school I just couldn't help but always feel shitty and lonely. I had a small group of friends who I'd play games with but it never changed how I feel. I don't know how to even properly express myself. On top of all this loneliness I found out I drew the short straw below the belt. All the social media jokes, girls I've met who made fun of people below the built not hung has taken an even bigger tole on me because any hope I had of approaching a girl I immediately try to get out of my mind because I don't want to know what will happen if any girl I met emotionally destroyed me because of something out of my control. On top of all this I can't for the life of me bring myself to enjoy anything. I feel like I've grown up to just not enjoy anything but be a lazy loser. I go to the gym and I'm in shape but that's almost a temporary relief. I also feel I'm at an age where the way I am is almost set in stone. So I'm doomed to be a living waste who just does nothing. I just feel like people out there have much more valid reasons to want to be suicidal, but here I am entertaining this idea. I've already thought about what I would write, where I would do it, How I'd do it. I just cannot help but feel lonely at all times and it's killing me at this point.",1

"People tell me I'm talented, I'm gifted, I'm a ""cool guy""......but I just can't bring myself to ""accept"" those kinds of compliments.I feel like everything I do is bound to end in failure. I'm slipping up in pretty much everything I do at this point, to where I start to ask myself ""why I do even bother continuing to do this?"" I have been told over and over that I'm just not ""good enough"", by teachers and colleagues, that I'm just ""wasting my time"".I personally find myself to be just an annoyance to people. My friends are starting to ignore me more and more and I recently lost a friend after he told me that he didn't want to be around me anymore because he thought I was an annoying twat around him. Making new friends is an extremely hard task for me because I'm very socially awkward, and I don't have many interests in anything these days, which makes it rather hard for me to have much in common with anyone.I don't even think my family cares much about me. My parents don't even say they ""love"" me anymore or show any form of affection. I am always ignored during family meetings. My mom sold my car without my consent and stole $4000 of my financial aid refund for her personal gain.I have tried to talk with others about it, but I never found it helpful. In fact, my depression is actually starting to annoy my friends to where they tell me not to make it a habit, whenever I act up. No one really asks ""what's wrong?"" or ""how can I help?"" They just don't care anymore. Are they really my friends anymore?All this led me to believe that I'm nothing more than just an annoying twat who always fails at ""simple things"" and is just not ""good enough"". I hate myself and I don't understand I even still have friends, or as they so say they are. I've considered suicide many times and attempted it a few times in the past.",0

When he was fully recovered Pierre told the the farmers daughter he would take her for a picnic as a reward, the picnic went well until the farmers daughter turned amorous & she said 
""oh, Pierre kiss me, kiss me""Pierre the famous French fighter pilot agreed and before he kissed her opened a bottle of red wine and poured it over her lips.

He replied ""I'm Pierre the famous French fighter pilot, if I eat red meat, I drink red wine.""Oh, she said, ""Pierre kiss me lower, kiss me lower!"" So Pierre opened a bottle of white wine and poured it over her breasts. As he suckled on her breasts the farmers daughter proclaimed ""that was amazing, but what was the white wine for?"" Pierre replied "" I'm Pierre the famous French fighter pilot, if I eat white meat, I drink white wine!"".The farmers daughter in throws of passion says ""oh, Pierre, kiss me lower, kiss me lower!

"Quite honestly I feel like that's more or less the story of my life when it comes to doing anything. Making friends? Social anxiety's got me covered. Making something of myself? Depression and scatterbrain forgetfulness will help me keep my motivation down and in my fucking place.It goes without saying for how badly I want to die. I've wanted to die this badly for years now, only able to ignore when I can both have something to distract myself and my own brain decides it wants to give me a fucking break with feeling absolutely miserable. Somehow I had it in my head that being at college would help -- force me into an environment where I could try something different. Be around people my age and hopefully learn how to be a human being that can laugh, drink, screw and enjoy other people's company.But of course that's not happening.Instead I've only dug myself into a deeper ditch where I can watch other people my age having friends, laughing, enjoying one's company while I sit here like a fucking statue watching them and constantly being reminded that I will never have the things that they have to make life worth living.And if I can't find life worth living, then what's the point of even trying? If anything, merely existing brings people down more than it lifts people up with how goddamned socially awkward I am -- not even getting started on other shit that's wrong with me.So yeah I want to kill myself, but at the same time, I know how pointless it to want it because somehow I can't help but think it's going to be yet another thing I cannot have. That I'll sabotage it, or some fucked up God in this world will lay the cards out to ensure I fail or chicken out at the last minute. I can see myself sticking a gun in my mouth and I fantasize about having the balls to pull the trigger before getting frustrated when I know that I don't have the balls and will never have the balls and just chicken out at the last second.It's at that moment when I go ahead and let that single instance in my head fade away that I feel truly trapped. Like I don't have any sort of escape unless someone kills me against my own will. Something I can't help but doubt happening because of how goddamned ""lucky"" I seem to be -- always feeling at the bottom of life, but always being just out of reach of happiness or prosperity for that tease to simply exist.Sorry if this rambling mess doesn't make any fucking sense, but the TL;DR I guess is that I fucking hate living and I fucking hate myself for not having the resolve to just end my life. At least then I could pretend in that instance that I had something.",1

Recent thoughts of suicide and talking to someone about it,1
"Recently I've been feeling like I'm useless for many reasons,
I am a 18 Year old currently in the uk and I've made many wrong choices in the world for example gone down the wrong side career path which is now too long late to change, which I am not going to get anywhere in.
Feel as so I will never get a job that keeps me with a roof over my head, food and things that I wish to have.
I am over weight and find it really hard to lose weight, I've been trying for over 5 years.
I've got no friends.
No one ever speaks to me, only with small talk or one word.
I get ignored by lots of people.
When walking passed people around college, even people who I never met before, they all say nasty things or take the mick, which I don't know why because I have done anything.
Even one of my tutors wasn't really friendly whom I had last year as she always picked on me and never believed what I said.
I've never had a girlfriend, I've felt like I have fallen in love once before when I was 15 and i thought she felt the same about me due to the way she acted and spoke, when I told her how I felt about her she never spoke to me again and got a group of people who threaten me as it turned out she was just using me.
However this last year I have found someone new, which I have feelings like I've never felt before but she seems to good for me as I'm scared to tell her how I feel because of what happened last time and I know she will reject me as I'm not perfect at all but I also feel as if I find someone I truly like it will change my life completely.
Im completely unattractive
My anxiety makes everything worse what I do.
I am a very shy person.
My life goes down hill each and everyday, things becoming more worse for me then ever
People look down at me as if I'm _
They are many other reasons wh I'm feeling down.
I know some of you will probably laugh at me because I'm pathetic, but this is how I feel but I'm scared of dying.
The only people who seem to care about me is probably my family.",1

"Saw this on Spotted Portsmouth:Why females should avoid a girls night out after they are married...The other night I was invited out for a night with the 'girls.'
I told my husband that I would be home by midnight, 'I promise!' 
Well, the hours passed and the margaritas went down way too easily.
Around 3 a.m., a bit loaded, I headed for home.Just as I got in the door, the cuckoo clock in the hallway started up and cuckooed 3 times. Quickly, realizing my husband would probably wake up, I cuckooed another 9 times. I was really proud of myself for coming up with such a quick-witted solution, in order to escape a possible conflict with him. (Even when totally smashed.... 3 cuckoos plus 9 cuckoos totals = 12 cuckoos MIDNIGHT!) The next morning my husband asked me what time I got in, I told him 'MIDNIGHT'... he didn't seem pissed off in the least. Whew, I got away with that one!    Then he said  'We need a new cuckoo clock.'When I asked him why, he said, 'Well, last night our clock cuckooed three times, then said 'oh sh1t.' Cuckooed 4 more times, cleared its throat, cuckooed another three times, giggled, cuckooed twice more, and then tripped over the coffee table and farted.",0

"See history for last post. Some things have happened since the last post. Kinda made a friend/acquaintance. Not evicted yet. Still in no shape to be doing regular people stuff. Posting cause I want to be heard, not looking for advice. I'm fucked, nobody else's  plan or words is going to change that. I know I'll slump into homelessness soon. Perhaps, even better, I'll get a ruling against me on the eviction and be basically unable to rent for 7 years. This issue, pressing as it may be, does not alarm me and push me into survival mode. The opposite in fact.  My safety net, emergency ermegency funds are gone. Some old debts have even gone into  collection. I have issues. A while ago I was almost on track to apply for disability benefits with the help of a therapist. What else is a bunch of psych visits and a bipolar/PTSD diagnosis good for? Still, that life is shit.Then my dad offed himself and I was left with enough money to fuck me up, but too much to admit I needed help. I knew it would, it has. It's mostly gone. I spent the money purely on limiting my interaction with people and other stressors as I then saw them. It is possible to cling to life in most wretched circumstances. I guess losing what I have will force me to 'live' more than I have been willing to. Thus the 'friend'. We met whilst sleeping rough on the street. In a few months it'll be a year since my last attempt. I'm getting out and walking and preparing hiking supplies. The uncertainty of the wilderness is alluring. As is the minimally social aspect.

"senior year has just started, i spent the summer completely alone because my friends that i've had my whole life have grown up to be bullies and druggies/alcoholics. i perceive myself as someone who is better than that so i pushes them away, but this summer was too hard so i made amends.. some days are better than others but sometimes they can all be SUCH dicks.. & i know you're thinking just make new friends but really i don't know how and it's senior year i'm not going to be seeing anymore of these people soon anyway.. not wanting the friends i have really fucks me up upstairs.i've grown up a larger kid, but since i started drinking with my friends almost a year ago now i've been gaining weight much more rapidly. i can only get into the mindset every once in a while but i loose motivation quickly. i'm 260 now and over the summer i've grown stretch marks. i feel absolutely disgusting and even than doesn't want me to lose it. i try as much as i can to be healthy but i always forget and as i'm chowin' down i remember and say fuck it. not looking healthy as i should i believe has always kept me from a girlfriend. i've had a few flings i guess, but after the girl decides it's over (every time) i realize she was just using me for a tool wether it's money or someone to get affection from. i strongly feel that everyone around me or knows me feels like they can use me as a tool but i would prefer to help someone get something they need rather than stand up for myself. i've been told i'm a very nice person, almost too nice. and i see it, but like i said, i would rather make someone else's day even if it fucks me over in the end. that's why i also think my 4 flings haven't ended up in a relationship or anything past 2nd base. i think loneliness fucks me up too. the final thing i will list is my home/family situation. parents divorced at 4. it was agreed that each parent would get 50/50. we switched houses every two days. i think that having two homes alone can fuck you up, but switching every two days? fuck that. i have a sister who's two years younger, and we did it together. we always liked our mom more, she was love-able and provided a much more fun & laid back living situation, but she was stern when she needed to be. my dad was more strict, but fun in the early years. my dad has anger issues and is an alcoholic and likes to yell, especially when he's upset. but we grew up with it. my dad got remarried in 2013 and i disliked her, but was afraid to tell him as that is mean to say/backlash from that statement. but now all she does is order us around, tries to control everything including my mom, and is generally bitchy (even my dad thinks so). it's gotten to the point where i don't talk to her and my dad is too much of an asshole to me and my sister that i can stand. so over the summer i stayed with just my mom (my dad didn't care because my mom is closer in town) and my mom couldn't pay for it. she filed a thing to take a look at the child support payment which has been the same since the divorce. this friday it was my dads weekend but i didn't want to go out there because i'm tired of it, so i ignored them until about noon when my dad called my mom and told her to tell me to talk to them, i didn't. eventually my stepmom blew up at my mom which wasn't right she has nothing to do with this situation. i finally told my mom that i want to live with her full time. after that my dad showed up and we had a long conversation about it all & i felt like shit because we were all fighting and we shouldn't have to in the first place, and i wouldn't want my son to do what i did to him. he was mad about my mom wanting money and seems like that was the only reason he wanted me to stay out there with him. he didn't confirm that i could stay with her but he didn't say no. long story long i really hate myself about the whole situation and it's sad. among other things i bottle my emotions up and can't handle my stress. i'm over apologetic. i've had a literal headache since 2015. im only mediocre at things in life, and feel i'm getting more dumb everyday. i get made fun of by almost everyone and most days i feel like no one actually cares. i have reached out to others about this but they literally don't care. i don't wanna live past graduation. don't know what i would do. i've been thinking of a way i want to do it and just haven't decided. i don't know what to do and i had no one to talk to. sorry this is all over the place i was trying to think of everything and this definitely isn't everything.. just the most important to me.",1

"She and I were good friends for a while, then I fell in love, then a week later she said no thanks very much, and cut off contact. I knew she'd been going through a really hard time, and the more friends the merrier, so I did my best to fall out of love again, but it was cripplingly difficult. I'd never had any of those feelings before. When I succeeded eventually, I tried to reach out and say that I hoped we could agree to forgive and forget, and that if she ever needs someone to talk to then I remain a friend for my part. But I made some (dumb but understandable) mistakes along the way and she now believes I'm a dangerous psychopathic stalker. I wanted to try and help alleviate some of her troubles and now I'm a cause of them. She's afraid of me. I don't want her to be. I'd rather be dead, and I certainly believe I don't deserve to live after this. If she knew I was dead, she wouldn't be afraid of me, and you don't feel guilty for the death of a monster, but... at the same time I have friends and family who don't think I did anything immoral, and although I don't contribute much to them or to society, I'd be letting them down. I don't know what to do. I just know that if I knew it would make things better for her, I would choose to die. It's been months since I was in love with her, but I love her very much, if that makes any sense. That's something that will never be understood or believed, because sticking someone in the Monster Box and keeping them there is easier than actually forgiving them. :/What would you do if someone you cared about was terrified of you? How could you know that and justify being alive?",1

Short Question! I don't really know how to talk about suicide unless I'm anonymous on the internet.,1
"Short version. I am a 54yo female. Abused sexually. physically, and emotionally from age 3-16, multiple actors.  Tried to kill my self for the third time (many previous cries for help) in July.  Cannot get it done. Husband now has memory loss, and am caring for 91yo mother. Have no friends left, and my family has never been there for me.  Husbands friends and family have either died or abandoned us in another way. I also have multiple medical problems, the worst of which are spinal stenosis, and lumbar spondylosis which cause chronic pain for which they will not give me any opiates due to my psych history.  Neither hubby nor I can work, and live on less than $1,700/month on SS disabilityMy psychiatrist, and therapist, have become complacent.  Psych had a fairly good med combo, but it did not keep the last attempt at bay. Therapists is okay, but mostly I think that she is amused by me; not in a bad way though. She just doesn't direct the conversation, or make me work on anything.  Neither suggested hospitalization after this most recent event. They do not know everything about my past, mostly just the light molestation by my stepdad, but everything about my present.My PCP I rarely see, and her NP is virtually useless.  This was not always true, prior to their takeover by a corporate hospital group.  They used to actually listen, but have no time, and their hands are tied as far as options.  They are aware of my attempts, but not my upbringing.I guess I am just tired of trying, and getting it wrong.  First real attempt was when I was 18.  Just married, had an affair with hubbys bff, and realized that leaving my childhood home did not solve all of my problems. Pills and booze, not recognized by anyone as an attempt, so not hospitalized.Second attempt was after the hubby had an affair with our bff, and she said she was pregnant with his baby.  Due to my childhood I cannot have kids, so the pregnancy was the kicker.  That was an attempted asphyxiation. Think those guys they find 'hanging,' but I was not masturbating.This last time I took almost six times the lethal dose of a medication that I am on (not commonly used for suicide) and all I got was two knees bruised so badly that I could not walk for 3 days, and I spent two of those days hallucinating.  Hubby did not even attempt to get me help, and actively tried to talk me out of calling 911.Not normally a whiner, but I am just really frustrated that no matter how much I try to get things right, doing research and such, I am still stuck here.  I do finally have what I assume is a fool proof plan that does not include a gun, since I cannot purchase one legally, and no longer have any connections to get one illegally.  I am also not really looking for any kind of help (living or dying) unless you can give me the winning powerball numbers so I can afford a good nursing home for Mom, and maybe Hubby.  Just looking to get it off my chest, I guess.",0

"Since I can remember I have always known that I don't belong, one of the first things I can clearly remember was my fathers hate of me, his anger that I was even a being. His disgusted looks at me made him harm me and witness the evils of a mans capabilities.I am free of his gaze and feel nothing for him, yet since I was 3 I have made many attempts and one of the first thoughts of any given day is that 'why am I still alive', and one of the last thoughts of any given day is 'I hope I don't wake up'.People around me know of part of my struggles and how I feel, but they see me wanting to commit suicide as a selfish act, like most people do, but to me what's selfish is wanting someone around, who is suffering and see no end to that suffering. I understand why people commit suicide and I don't think they are selfish, we all just want the pain to go away and for some the only way to do so is to commit suicide, what's selfish about that?I believe that I am here to suffer and endure. I am a witness to humanity and I've seen every facet of the evil in a person. Very rarely I see goodness and kindness, and even then I question if it's for selfish reasons.We are all selfish beings who want what we want, I hate that aspect of myself.My first attempt was at aged 3 (yes 3 you read correctly) I set alight my bed as I knew fire purged wrong's from the world. As the fire licked at my skin it did not burn, and simply was extinguished.Another attempt was around 12 when knowing how to tie knots and the tensile strength of the rope I used, I could achieve the goal of ending my suffering. A proper tight noose was tied and as I kicked the chair over the beam supporting my weight, the rope snapped as though someone swung a sword. the strands of rope were cleanly cut, yet what I witnessed was an impossibility just as I saw 9 years previous.A year or so later at aged 14 I was walking back from school, and there was a high walking bridge that went across a dual-carriageway, I stopped and knew it was time for me to try once more and so I stood over the railings and let go. The reason I am able to write about this today is because my foot was caught in the railing, leaving me hanging upside down like in the cartoons when a character is trapped by another. Managing to get myself up with the aid of another I simply limped home with a somewhat twisted ankle. I told the person that a bully had tried to throw me over.Other attempts have included poison's, stepping out in front of vehicles (yes this is a bad one but when your in that mindset you don't care) I have and never would attempt to jump in front of a train (that's just not right, having someone clean miles long tracks).It would appear that I am here for something, as every attempt I make is circumvented somehow.There is a lot I could write or say to my story but I guess I am still searching for a cure to my suffering and pain. I am in receipt of medical help and support though I feel that currently there is no new information that I don't already know, or could find for myself. A long and slow process I am sure. At 25 I feel as I always have; empty, alone and in pain.",1

I am sure someone here, if they read this, will say that I need to find a new therapist/psychiatrist. But what is the point? I'm so broken that I need to shop around for someone to tell me life is worth living?I have had some trauma in my life but I seriously cannot seem to do more than the bare minimum. I eat 1-2 times a day. Sometimes I drink 7 days a week. Usually not to get trashed, but it burns some time after work before I have to avoid my roommates until I fall asleep. Rinse and repeat the next day.My family adores me and would be just as proud if I cleaned a gutter then if I was a senator. I have a support group that cries and pleads to me to be happy and accept them. Can't do it.I have pushed all of my friends away to the point of ""have you thought about therapy?"" and romantic relationships have never been possible. I broke up with my first gf at age 13 because I couldn't handle being told she loved me. The two since then have been even worse. I've never been assaulted. I've never wanted for anything.

The second kid makes a three foot dent. The third kid thinks ""I cam beat that!"" And throws his brick in the air but it doesn't land.So a woman's mother was dying so she went to see her. She decided to bring a parrot with her, since her mother loved parrots. Sadly, the only flight she can afford is a no smoking and no parrot flight. ""Oh well, I can just smuggle the bird in"" so she hides the bird in her jacket. Just before takeoff, everything's going fine she hasn't been caught, the captain comes around making sure everyone is okay. When he comes to the woman, he has a cigarette in his mouth. ""Hey, are you all okay?"" He asks. ""Yep, all good"" she replies. Suddenly, the captain hears a ""Yep, all good"". ""What was that?"" He asks ""Oh nothing"" 
""Yep, all good""
""You have a parrot in here don't you?"" And he opens her jacket to see the parrot. ""You aren't allowed parrots on this flight"" he tells her. ""Well, you aren't allowed to smoke on the flight"" she replies. They start arguing and eventually the captain gets so angry he throws the parrot out the window. The woman starts to scream and throws his cigarette out the window. They argue some more until they hear a knock from outside. Its the parrot, and he has something in his mouth. Whats in his mouth?

So 4 weeks ago on Wednesday my best freind killed herself we met at the clinic after I'd attempted suicide that was 2 and a half years ago.At first I was angry at myself then at her and now life just seems pointless.My therapist said I should reach it to people and get help so here I am.Since she died I've attempted suicide twice and I've constantly thought about death.,1

"So basically my life is in shit and I've been in so much pain for a while. For the last 4 years I've been in a massive depression, and it was all leading up with my bad childhood, where my mother died when I was 8 and I had to live with my non loving dad for 10 years, until I was 18 - When I was 18 I moved out to live by myself and honestly it has been so tough, I have lived by myself for 4 years now. But as I moved out I also found the love of my life, but she didn't find me, so I've been struggling with a hard depression for all that time, which has led me to end my studies several times and do nothing. This made me not get any income and made me end up getting some stupid loans I can't pay back as well as being kicked out of my apartment soon because I can't pay the rent. I've just totally lost the will to live and I can't see a way to turn my life around or fix it at this point and I just feel like some things just can't be fixed and aren't meant to be... Where I am one of those things. I could go into a lot more detail, but this is just a short version of it. By continuing to live I will just end up with more pain, more debt and no place to live. Feel free to leave your thoughts, that's why I'm writing here after all",1

"So guys this is my story, I have a friend and she is close to me for almost 2 years. But i notice something that sometimes i feel like she used a mask for her everyday life. It is 3 mask And i the only person that notice it. The she said she have many problem, and many people thinks that she is super happy person with no problem at all. But all she did is faking her smile. Last night we call but  when i am trying to be there and say that she is not alone, she just push me back saying that she can drag me to her suicidal thought, and even if i stayed with her, the situation wit her suicidal thought won't change. She said :""Don't have any hope, don't know how to hope, don't know what to hope for..""She learn psychology, she said that ppl with suicidal thought can survive with hope, but she has none.I don't want everything turn like Chester Bennington. But i don't know what to do right now. I want to give her hope, but I don't know how",1

"So i don't know what i should do anymore, I've attempted suicide before multiple times. Reaching out to my mom was the first thing i did after my first attempt failed, this was in middle school I called her told her what I did and she picked me up and i spent the night with her. I was living with my dad at the time since my parents were split. I'm not really sure what happen'd to cause me to become so suicidal and i might've forgotten at this point honestly but, its turned my life into a downward spiral. Once i entered middle school i completely started skipping class, i would sleep through them or skip. This continued until once again at the end of my middle school life i attempted suicide. This was the first time i had to be hospitalized for it and once again i asked for help and ended up at a therapist. Talking to him I lied constantly lied, lied, and lied. This was well how i was raised by my mom. I don't know if she was embarrassed of me or what but, when she got remarried she had me constantly lie to the guy. This started up even more once i started high school.I have 2 siblings one older and one younger sister. Their treatment is 200x better than me, throughout my freshman year of high school I always slept on the floor in our house we had a spare room but my mom made me sleep on the floor still i really don't know why. My older sister would let me sleep in her bed sometimes but not always. In my second year i got a laptop this is when i started playing games to keep my mind of suicide i honestly couldn't take my life at this point. I would constantly read books from the library during class resulting in extremely poor grades but, i didn't care to me I always felt worthless anyways only my 2 sisters were meant to be anything i was always going to be trash. My mom would make sure to always compare me to my older sister i hated it so much but, always i would bottle it up never say anything. My second year of high school i dropped out. Since then I've done everything i could to just find something interesting to keep myself happy even the smallest thing. Whenever my mom tells me something I'd just bottle it up and turn away. I've only ever gotten angry and yelled twice once in elementary and another last week when i just couldn't take it anymore.My mother constantly has me lying to friends and family telling them im in college or doing well i can't take this anymore i don't even know if i can try to pick up my life at this point. I honestly am just thinking of grabbing the gun in our house and ending it all. I've never had any friends to talk to the only person i could talk to was my mother and she didn't help when i reached out to her. I just don't know what to do anymore.",0
"So I gave birth just over a year ago and started showing signs on depression during my pregnancy (was under a lot of stress in my personal life) and had a traumatic birth experience. I developed postpartum anxiety and PTSD and depression but have always been more anxious then depressed but the last few weeks I've felt more depressed, just feeling really stuck in my job and exhausted and hopeless and overwhelmed. I would never actually do it, honestly I don't think I'm brave enough too, and also I love my family and usually my life. And lately when I'm feeling really exhausted and anxious about how I'm going to get my shit together all of a sudden I'll imagine myself drinking a bottle of bleach or swallowing a bottle of pills or getting hit by a car. Like I'd never kill muself but I wish I could escape my life sometimes, almost like have something happen to me so I can escape my life and not worry about anything for awhile. I work in healthcare. I'm just so tired of being haunted by my birth still and always being so tired from working overnights and having a baby and a husband who's also depressed so I feel guilty ever asking him for more help or too afraid to tell him my darkest thoughts.

Well that shits left me fucked up. Ive gone 40+ hours without sleep, and all I can think about is how I should of killed myself long before this moment.It  was a lot of fun and she taught me some cool shit, but it just feels wrong that it happened, and the no condom thing has me freaking out. Im in control enough right now to get to a hospital if I start going down further, but Im just hoping and can maintain that. I don't know how anyone can really help me here, but this one of those times where I'm really struggling and I just have to put these thoughts somewhere where someone may understand...Edit: my suicidal ideations/ obsessions had been coming back alot recently because of stress.

So I just turned 24 and its almost been a year since my 5 year relationship ended and I feel completely hopeless. I feel like I've always given up my whole life on everything and the way others see me kills me inside. I want to have love for myself but I feel like I shouldn't since my relationship fell apart and I hate myself for that. Sometimes I've heard quotes about getting so worried and having life pass you by... that's where I'm at. I literally feel like losing that relationship is the worst thing that could of ever happened and I don't want to go on. I also just feel pathetic in general that this is where my life has ended up.

              I'm a high schooler and pretty much athletics has been the only thing to keep me going.Im almost positive I have a lot mental disorders simply because of the lack of interaction I've gotten.The only places I've ever been to in my life has been the store, their meetings, school, and home.Anyways, I joined athletics and discovered that I am actually pretty good at wrestling.As soon as I joined it my grades skyrocketed and I've been so happy. I shouldn't have tried.Pretty much now they banned me from doing that because it's also bad associationI'm tired of living a life like this and I can't see any good place my life is headed.It would be extremely hard for me to even try going to college and if I do try to make a life that is good, I know that everybody I know will shun me.
        It just feels like I'm wasting my time by living and it's just going to cause me more suffering.The one thing that made me think better about life now gets ripped away from me. I cannot understand how parents just assume that their kid will follow their religion and force them to live their life by gods word

"So many people, my boss, my family, tell me that I'm pretty much worthless and think too much of myself. I really don't. It's just a front I put on so I don't have to face that part of me deep inside that agrees with them, that I have no purpose living this life. After just being told that I'm worthless for maybe the fourth time this week (and it's only Tuesday morning for God's sake), I can't stop the tears right now. The Germans used to say, that crying is a sign of admitting guilt whereas anger is a sign of innocence. I know I'm worthless. I believe them. I agree fully. Most of me doesn't see hope anymore and honestly, ending this pathetic sad tiring life would be such a satisfying release from this endless cycle of uselessness. Only a small part of me is left that doesn't wanna give in yet, I've seen how happy some people's life can get if they manage to find courage and worth in life, and I crave to have that myself someday. But with each passing day, I cave in and give up a little more. Can somebody please tell me how I can stop myself from feeling worthless and actually believe in myself? ",1
"So my girlfriend's friend texted her about 30 minutes ago about how her parents just beat the shit out of her and kicked her out so I went to go pick her up to bring her back to my girlfriend's house. At the moment, we're at my girlfriend's house and her friend is talking to us about what's happened throughout the day. Her dad basically said ""if you're thinking about killing yourself just do it already."", and he also hit her a couple of times after forcing himself into her room while she's changing (she's here without any undergarments, just a loose cloth dress), and they kick her out. She tells us that he was basically trying to guilt her into not killing herself, ""it's crazy that you would want to kill yourself after I didn't kill you in the womb."" Sorry if this is all over the place i'm just trying to relay the severity of the situation and I really want some help about how to help her with this situation. She can't stay at my girlfriend's house because at the moment she has nothing but the dress she has on and her phone, and her parents expect her home by 5 today (about 30 minutes from now) for dinner at their friends' house.

"So one day she asks: Honey could you please pick up some more escargots for moi, S'il vous plat. Now this guy loves his french wife beaucoup and also she is still so hot and escargots increase sexual desire, at least in his wife. So of-course he accepts this quest. But after he bought the escargots, he passes by his favorite bar and he can't resist the temptation. Some of his best mates are there and so instead of going straight home he opted in for having a good time at the bar. As he is having fun drinking beer and sharing some of the best jokes he knows from  he completely forgets about the escargots. Finally around 2 am the bar closes and he starts the walk home (he has a car but this is a wholesome joke and it's only a 2 km walk) 
When he is standing at the front door trying to find his keys in the dark, they fall on the ground. He bends forward to pick them up and then two things happen: the snails fall out of his pocket on the ground and his wife slams the door open at the same time.

"So this all started around 5 years ago when my great grandad died. I didn't know him very well as i was around 8 or 9 at the time but when he died all I remember is my mum lying with my dogs crying her eyes out. I now know this is because my mum didn't have a dad growing up so she saw him as one. my great grandad dying caused my mum to become heavily depressed which soon progressed into alcoholism.My mum being an alcoholic. it has been going on for around 5 years now but I will just tell you all the times I can remember that are significant. First one is around 3 - 4 years ago my mum got shit faced and left, we found her a few hours later (I say we but it was my brother and dad as i was 10) and she came back and yelled then passed out. second time was a repeat of 1 just around a year later (it happened a few times.) 6th time (biggest) it was November 5th and my family was throwing a bonfire for some friends of there's (they used to be mine but I will get to that) and we made a huge bonfire behind our house in a field but we left our mum and her friend because it was cold and they didn't vcare but by the time we had gotten back my mum had drank around 3-4 bottles of wine (the equivalent of a pint of JD) and was out of it. later that night there friends have gone, my brother was sleeping in my room because he was scared of my mum (as when me and my dad were directing our guests back as they were wattlking) she had being saying things to him like ""do you want to die"" (she was drunk) later that night we woke up to the sound of my mum banging and yelling at my dad ""Alan, I need a fucking wee"" then started throwing stuff and smashing stuff so my dad called the police and she was put in a drunk ward for a 12 hours. final one for now, it was around june and my brothers girlfriend was around and he had bought me some csgo keys and made me a coke and rum (i'm 14 so there was 10:1 coke to rum) and he had left like 100ml left and it was gone so he asked my mum and she started freaking out yelling at my brother girlfriend to get the fuck out of her house and that she is not welcome and the same at my brother and sines then (around 2 and a half months I have seen him once) and I had to spend the night at my mums friends house and she didn't pick up her phone and knowing how she is and what she has done before I thought she had slit her wrists and died this time.moving 200 miles away. After what happened my parents decided to move back to the north of england, moving closer to family I see once a year and 200 miles away from friends. I now have 1 friend ish and see my cousins once a week and am living with my grandma who is a compleat bitch (my family are still in nottingham and the reason i'm not friends with the other family is because of moving) Also school here is shit and all I do really is sit in the lessons, do all the work, do homework at lunch and come home and eat. basically my life has gone from worse to worse to worse and I truly believe there is nothing worth living for now  ",1

"So to get started, Hi, I'm Jessica. I'm a 20 year old trans-girl, I came out to a couple friends years ago, some a couple months ago. Just a few things to summarize me.However there is this sociopath in my life who I suspect fond out, the fucked up thing is, he goes as far as to file a police report making out I'M A FUCKING TERRORIST, mind you I almost committed suicide when detectives rocked up asking me about random shit I know nothing about, thankfully there not back. Who wouldn't when you're getting threatened with 40 years and the detectives are coming off like I did shit to get information out of me (good cop, bad cop kind of bullshit)If this guy hates you that much, he'll pick things to ""adopt"" and pretend to have, because he can't manipulate me directly, he manipulates everyone around me. My parents know NOTHING about transgender people, now thanks to this cunt they think there mentally ill, sexual perverts etc all thanks to this guy pretending to be transgender doing fucked up bullshit to attack me.The bastard has ruined all chances of me coming out, I joked around to my parents saying I was having a sex change, there constantly going on about this fuck tard and how I shouldn't copy him etc, and that I can do anything but get a sex change.Personally I kind of just want to grab a knife and slice my fucking neck until I die.To give you a idea of how low this cunt is, when he found out I had depression and selfed harmed in high school (though his mother) mother is best mates with mine etc, every class I was in, he would ""suddenly be depressed, make out he self-ed harmed, than would go on about how badly he was bullied in life etc. Literally copying my sob story, fucking cunt. I already feel no one cares about me, and you're confirming it.When he found out my dad was abusive and had bipolar, whenever he was around me, he would go upto random people abused the fuck out of them and say, oh sorry I have bipolar.Thanks to him, every fucking person around me has a fucked up idea of transgender people, and has made it impossible for me to transition and come out.My birthday is in a few days, and I'm considering killing myself then, every since I was a child I had nothing but bullying, people would always fucking forget my birthday, mother would be nice and say maybe they forgot it is fathers day, bullshit other people I know with a birthday a week after mine, had tons of fucking people rock up.I'm not a person who hates people, but personally if it wasn't illegal, I would beat and kick the living shit out of this sociopathic cunt. every fucking person he hates, he will destroy mentally, I suffer constant panic attacks from him, I had the shit kicked out of me by bullies, HE WOULD MAKE OUT THAT I WAS THE FUCKING BAD GUY, yeah totally I get my fucking finger sliced open, I'm the bad guy for slapping them in self defense, fuck off cunt, went as far as to threaten to break my nose and assault me simply for self defense, AFTER TELLING ME I SHOULD STICK UP TO MYSELF.I just don't know what the fuck to do. I've already had to import the drugs I need to transition and risk harming my health due to this fuckhead.Basically he'll take the role of a transgender person, destroy the image of transgender person, he is literally going around saying he is mentally ill, can't help wearing dresses and being a sexual pervert etc, just to fucking get at me for some fucked up reason that I don't know.He knows that I'm still transitioning and not giving a fuck so he has stopped because it's making him look like a fucking moron.(PPS)99.9% of trans people don't fake being transgender, just like 99.9% of cancer patients don't fake cancer etc.The thing with this guy is if he finds out something about me, the next day he'll suddenly have it go around posing like he has it, than destroy the legitimacy of such thing.He is so bad at lying that there are holes in every little fucking thing he says yet people believe every word that comes out his mind. He did the same thing with my autism he made out that he was autistic for a good week or so while doing and saying stupid shit that makes all of autistic people look bad.He does this with every little thing, found out I was deaf, would make out I was mishearing shit and that I was retarded DESPITE hearing it correctly and confirming it with the news article title that was fucking published.Last and not least, I've been searching for a job that last 2 years, I'm not getting anywhere and I'm in a shit ton of debt that is driving me mental.While I have been diagnosed with ""depression and anxiety"" I'm not on meds because my parents think I don't need them and that ""I'm faking it"", you guessed it due to the fucking sociopath.",1
"So yeah. 95% of the time I'm contemplating suicide. I've been told all my life that it's the most selfish thing one could do, but is ending your life really selfish if continuing to live would be worse? The top reasons I want to commit suicide are as follows:1) School. This is my first year in a public school (I've been homeschooled all my life). Now that I'm in the NCVA, my grades have plummeted, even though I spend a lot more time doing schoolwork. As a homeschooler, most of my test results were in the college level, as a public schooler, I'm below average. It's absolutely taken over my schedule, and it's the number one reason I want to die.2) My Mom. She certainly knows how to make my free time miserable. She treats nobody kindly, not even my Dad. She has no clue how to raise someone with autism (more on that later). So yeah, quite frankly, she's a b*tch.3) My siblings. I know numbers 2 and 3 are stereotypical, but in my opinion, I have the most selfish, self-centered, bratty siblings ever. At least my youngest brother is cute.4) My schedule. Most of the free time I have I have to lie about. My parents don't even know I have a Reddit account, and they would kill me if they found out (at least then I would be happy).5) My disorders. I have autism, and I'm 80% sure I have bipolar too. Autism I actually like, although it does make my social life awkward, but at the end of the day, I wouldn't lose it if I could. Bipolar on the other hand I would gladly lose. And the worst part is, nobody else knows I have it.Sorry if that was a bit weird. I just like to lay things out mechanically. You could say it's an autism superpower. So 95% of my life is hell. The other 5% of my life is when I'm at church (and I don't even consider myself a Christian). When I'm at church, I help out in children's ministry, get to see my friends (the main reason I haven't committed suicide yet, aside from me being a p*ussy, is them), play video games (yeah, my church is awesome), and just have an all around blast. Unfortunately, 5% of my life isn't enough to keep my going. I'm 12, and nearly jumped off a wall on Wensday. I don't know how long it will be until I follow through with it.P.S Thanks if you read all that. At least there's someone out there who cares...",1
"So yeah. 95% of the time I'm contemplating suicide. I've been told all my life that it's the most selfish thing one could do, but is ending your life really selfish if continuing to live would be worse?

So yesterday my wife called and told them I felt suicidal hoping that if they did anything I'd get a script of xanax or something. But no the dr wanted to send me to some bullshit facility that I've been too twice. They are there for their paycheck and that's it they don't give a fuck about you. Anyways I'm feeling fine I told them I wanna go home dr said I have to go no matter what so I took off my hospital gown and for some reason they forgot to take my bag of clothes so I put my clothes back on and made a jet for the door I'm a pretty big guy so I guess the female security didn't want to fuck with me anyways I make it deep into the woods and spend 3 hours next to a main highway seeing cops going up and down for about 30-40 mins I still have my phone so I made a call to my friend who picked me up I had to go through thick ass woods ended up with cuts all on my legs and shit but I made it to my friends vehicle and now I'm staying at his house out of state. Im wondering how long before I can return to my house without going to that bullshit place I'm fine. They showed up to my house and told my wife that am not going to be charged with any charges for breaking the law they would just try to take me back to the hospital and re-evaluate me with they stop looking after a week and it just be considering a missing persons report?

"So, a guy with a small monkey on his shoulder walks into a bar,  the bartender isn't too thrilled about an animal being in a bar,  but he says nothing deciding to see if it's behaving first. Guy orders a drink and the monkey is just sitting there watching someone play pool. All of a sudden the monkey jumps on to the pool table,  grabs one of the billiards and swallows it. The bartender gets pissed off and tells at the guy to get his damn monkey out of there. Guy apologises and leaves. About a week later,  same guy with same monkey walks back in,  but this time the monkey is on a leash. Bartender is keeping a close eye on the monkey,  to make sure it doesn't try any more monkey business. Monkey is on its best behaviour,  just sitting there,  then it spots some grapes on the table, it grabs a single grape, looks at it then shoves it up is own ass, pulls it back out and eats it. ""What the hell is that disgusting monkey doing?!?"" Yells the surprised bartender. ""Oh that?"" Says the guy, ""After the trouble that billiard ball gave him on the way out,  he now measures everything first before eating it.""",0
"So, I just wanted to leave part of my story behind before I kill myself. I experienced a family loss a few years ago and closely after my long term relationship ended. On top of that the stress from the hardest year of college piled up and I had some sort of a breakdown. From that point on I couldn't study anymore and the last years were a constant cycle of avoiding, anxiety attacks, dread, suicidal thoughts and so on.
I started therapy a few months ago, already been for about 14 appointments and although there have been some little improvements, I feel like that it just can't help me enough. The therapist said that what I experienced years ago is some kind of trauma and that we could work on that.
These past months have been literal hell for me, having experienced another loss in my family just 3 weeks ago.
Tomorrow should be the final(and most important exam) for which I have studied basically nothing.
I feel like I can't go on living like this, so I decided that tonight will be where it all ends.
I suppose this is where the story end and another does not begin.",1
"So, I went with 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.",0
"So, I'm 33 and, for easily the past 15 years, I've seen no worth in getting up in the morning. I started fantasizing about killing myself when I was ten years old. I'd walk around the elementary school where my mom works and imagine people finding me in different closets or alcoves. I was home schooled and didn't have any friends for most of my teenage life. Between the ages of 15 and 23, I literally didn't see anyone of my own age for months on end. I felt incredibly isolated, lost, scared, and worthless. I thought of suicide every day. In the past 23 years I've been in tons of therapy programs and have tried incredibly hard to grow myself as a person. I've tried to grow and learn to make friends. Every step of the way has been a struggle. I had to practice making eye contact, then practice shaking hands, then practice hugging, etc. I didn't have my first girlfriend until I was 27, my first job until I was 28, or get my driver's license until I was 29. I've never had sex or even done much beyond kissing with a girl. I'm afraid because I don't know what I'm doing. I grew up around women and I am afraid of disappointing them or making them feel pressured or uncomfortable. The women I'm drawn to are almost always conservative sexually, but eventually I know I have to be capable of living up to their expectations. When you're in your thirties, that's intimidating. Last year I fell in love with a women I worked with. I quit my job to be with her. We dated for six months and she broke up with me because I lost my job. I'm still jobless, almost three months later. I was in a car accident and have no car. I have rheumatoid arthritis and can't afford my medicine, so it's hard for me to walk or do any exercise. My girlfriend and I planned for a summer filled with trips and time together and instead I spent my summer alone, bedridden, broke, heartbroken and desperate. Nothing makes me happy and I have no one who loves me or wants to truly be with me. I've been in a combined 9 months of romantic relationships over the course of my entire life and both women left me and broke my heart. I have a master's degree but can never find a job that pays me a living wage. I'm in constant pain and my every waking moment is consumed by missing what I've lost. I feel like a hollow, immaterial thing. Like I'm already lost and exist in remnants only, like I'm light and insignificant enough to float away without detection. I genuinely feel like there's no point in going on. I've tried to kill myself twice before, with the most recent time being this time last year. That time, I ended up in the hospital and almost passed away. In each situation I felt overwhelmed to the point of panic. Suicide felt like something that was a solution to temporary lack of reason. Now I have a very logical, almost calming belief that there's really no point to going on. It's like the thought of quitting a bad job or anticipating the end of a bad experience. I intellectually believe that life - at least the one I have - is not worth living. I miss my girlfriend desperately. I gave up everything for her. She had issues too, and I gave everything I could to trying to help her, understand her and be there for her, even though it sometimes resulted in me feeling hurt, overlooked, and ignored. I believed in her, beyond any of her issues, but she didn't even believe in me beyond my current employment options. I can't do any better and I can't do any more. Every day when I go to sleep I plan to end my life the next day. It's the most encouraging thought I have as I drift off. I just needed to share. ",1
"So, Look back at my posts to see the story....
I've been doing fine up until this last week, It's now hit me really hard, I'm losing my whole life and I feel so alone! Divorce is the worst and I can't cope! I just want my life to end! ",1

"So. I need to talk to someone about suicide. I don't want to call the national helpline because it's a voiced call. Also, I'm scared they'll call the police on me if I say something about actually killing myself. I've found a few, but most of them suck, and a few of them are Christian oriented. They always end up making me listen to them rant about god until I decide I've had enough. Anyway, if there is a good one out there, please tell me. ",1
"So... my boyfriend has been in a suicide rehab center for the last month. He says that he's just over life. He's not sad, not depressed, generally enjoys stuff, but is also just over it all. He says it would just be easier to be dead. Now, I've never heard of anything like this before, I haven't been with a guy who's been suicidal, but I do have a friend who was in the Army who battles with depression and ""dark thoughts"" all the time... but I feel like this is a whole different animal. My army friend owns firearms, is well off financially, but dealing with things from his service time falls into depression a few times a year, but has never tried to take his life (given that he has firearms, I'm surprised.) But.. my boyfriend on the other hand, isn't depressed... isn't sad... is still doing all of the things he loves, sports, video games, occasional trip to the bar, etc. and usually seems like he's in a really good mood...  but for some reason he just doesn't feel the need to be here anymore. It's been a really difficult thing for me to understand, and it's starting to take a toll on me. (Not that I'm getting suicidal, but I'm just confused, having never dealt with this situation... I just don't understand how anyone can possibly think that way?)Has anyone else dealt with this before and if so.. what/how did you approach it? ",1

"Some days I feel deeply depressed. I'm a highly sensitive person diagnosed with bipolar depression. It must be annoying dealing with me because who wants to be with someone who always walk around eggshells or simply can't get over things quickly. I've been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder too. 
There was a point I was afraid going on planes, car rides, etc because I feared an accident.
I take criticism, disapproval, rejection very personally.
Sometimes I wish I could be free.
I took me this longest time to finally open myself up to having sex or letting a man touch me. I feel like that has ruined my relationship.
Or I perceived friends with benefits to be more than purely sex.
As I lie in my self pity and constant ruminating. I always feel angry or self righteous and bitter because there are people who are the exact opposite than me. They live their lives freely, carefree, etc. I'm not a more noble person because I'm highly sensitive. 
I'm frustrated I cannot seem to see the big picture.
Why can't I love myself?
It annoys me that some smug asshole goes to sleep perfectly fine even though he hurts others. He lashes out at others, while I self destruct. I feel pathetic.",0
"Some information about me, I am 20 years old and i recently transferred to a new school. I am a junior, and I have social anxiety. This past month has been hard. I legit do not have friends. I haven' t made any, and I don't see any on the horizon. I come from a big family, and I had a very large group of friends at my old school. I legit go to class, and then go back to my apartment because I just feel uncomfortable being out alone. I live alone, and the only thing I can think about is how easy it would be to just stop. It feels like no one, except maybe my mom, would even notice. I just feel so lonely and depressed, and i just want to end it. ",1

"Someone please help me diagnose/understand myself better.When I was young, I remember being constantly suicidal. Back then it was definitely due to depression growing up. I was a younger sibling who felt like my parents would only love/care for my older sibling and didn't like me much. They had us at a young age (early 20's) and she was a prodigy/excelled at school and everything she did while I was didn't even speak until I was 5 (i understood language but intentionally didn't verbally communicate) so they thought I was mentally slow. If an argument ensued between me and my sister, then regardless of whoever is right they would take her side and scold me. It was obvious to
everyone that they wished my sister was the guy due to hyper-traditional values and only kept me around the house because I was the one born with a penis.Then I'm not sure exactly when but somewhere in late elementary-middle school the beating started. I was physically disciplined and scolded before (apparently they hit me since I was 1) but I'm talking about beatings. I don't think I had it as bad as some others for it was never done under alcoholic/substance rage by my father and I never felt my life threatened but damn those were not pretty days. He'll call the school to say that I won't be coming in the next day and go at it. His courtesy was allowing me to wear long pants before the session began, put me in a push up position and beat me with either a hockey stick, wooden baseball bat or a golf practice club(sometimes he'd let me choose). These sessions weren't too often but more often than not, it would go on until I wasn't able to walk for the next following days. Sometimes I was actually guilty of what he was accusing, but sometimes I wasn't and that drove me mad for no amount of pleading and reasoning worked with him. It's also why I don't blame my mother as much. She was MARRIED to him, I can only imagine. (But he never laid a single finger on my mother or sister). But countless days went by with me on the floor crying like a maniac, envisioning the day that he would die.Then there was the eating disorder. This mostly had to do with my self-confidence I suppose but I became bulimic around then as well and threw up after every meal. It wasn't because I didn't like food- trust me it was pretty much the only thing that kept me alive. In fact I remember loving eating so much that I thought ""I live to eat"" and literally only threw up just so I could eat more, kinda like how the Romans used to do. But all this made me really overweight and I reached 210pounds by the end of 8th grade. But throughout all the time I hated being fat. My family made fun of me in public, I knew I didn't look good and would grab on my flabby stomach and cry in the shower.So this was around when (late elementary- around 9th grade) I was definitely depressed and suicidal everyday. I didn't know I was depressed back then because I simply didn't grasp the concept but it was bad. Where I was didn't have guns so I'd always grab a kitchen knife when everyone was asleep and tried cutting myself here and there but throughout all the years no matter how desperately suicidal I was, I could never muster the courage to actually slit my wrists deep enough. I was a freaking coward and I even hated myself more for that. The one thing I could actually have control over- I was too much of a fucking coward to pull through. I remember wishing if we were still in the States, without a doubt this was already over with with a gun. This went on for years, on a daily basis and I think that's when it became a part of me.Fast forwarding to the present- I am an excellent student at an well established university. I excel at both my studies and at my workplace that my future definitely looks bright, despite the current political and economic madness. During high school the abuse continued and intensified and my parents marriage fell apart but I found sports that I excelled in, lost all my weight and had a great social life, finally finding a life for myself out of my house.But when I reached adulthood I noticed that I has a love for knives. I love the way they feel, how it's built, how a right one feels so cozy and right against my hands. Holding onto it definitely helps me sleep. And I have no motivation to... live? More like I don't really care what happens, but I wish I died. Not because I'm depressed (it does come sometimes every now and then but haven't really had one since 2015) but for reasons I don't quite understand. Maybe it's because I've come to accept that life is mostly going to be filled with shittier moments than not, maybe it's the frustration with the human race and all the injustice of the world, Maybe I'm just bored or tired.
But I believe that death is the ultimate liberator. As we are chained on this world in a cycle of pain-temporary pleasures-grieves and sin, death is what sets us free. I often imagine/feel it as a long-separated lover that I long to embrace. Her kiss would set me free.
I think about death like how a star-crossed lover thinks about their significant other. Maybe today will be the day, or perhaps I must wait longer. If you read all of that, I truly thank you. It was long and you probably didn't need that in your life but I am curious and honestly somewhat concerned about my case (I know it's not normal, if anything).

I love all of you more than you can imagine.I wish I could go on living. But life was meant for the living, and I've been dying inside for a long time. Life, lived properly, lived as you all have lived it, looks so sweet. I've never felt worthy of that experience. I may not be the judge of this, but then again, who is? There is no real answer to that. So I may as well judge it for myself.I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. I don't want you to deal with this anymore.Love you forever,

"Someone PM me. Please. I don't want to do it.I don't want to die at all. I just want the pain to end. If I die, I want it to be quick. Like a car crash. I could handle that. Because at the end of the day, my mom wouldn't be the mom with the depressed kid, she'd be the unlucky mom. There wouldn't be anything she could've done to prevent it. I don't want my friends beating themselves up over a problem they couldn't fix. They'd remember the good qualities I had. The school wouldn't have any class about depression and how to tell the signs. They'd just hold a small vigil no one would go to and I'd be forgotten as quick as the crash was. ",1

"Someone who's confident.Someone who doesn't take things personally when they're not meant to be.Someone who knows how to be assertive.Someone who doesn't give a crap about what people think.Someone who doesn't find it hard to talk to unfamiliar people.Someone who could fit in.Why can't I be that? I feel like the way I am now prevents me from doing all that. I have 0 confidence, 0 assertiveness, 0 social ability. Maybe I can work to ""become that person"" but that would take way too much work. I'm undisciplined and I frequently perform less than my best on work, chores, and even things I do for fun. I don't even do much anymore because I'm unmotivated to. A lot of my lack of confidence stems from my dreams getting crushed a year ago. I don't see the point of trying to do much else if it's all going to be for nothing.I just want to die and reincarnate into someone with a better body, a better personality, a better everything. I keep trying to put on different names for myself. I keep imagining having a friend in real life I can rely on, and not just an Internet friend. I feel envious for people who aren't so lonely. I just think life would be better if I was born someone else.Except if reincarnation existed, I don't think you would be able to choose who you are in the first place. You're just assigned a body and you have no control over it. But even if it's not up to you, it would be nice to have another chance, and try to prevent growing up as a social retard. Maybe my next body won't have anger issues. They alienated me as a kid, and it's one of the reasons I never grew out of my shyness.Fuck me.",1

"Sometimes, I really think I am crazy. Looking back at all my past mistakes, and trust me, there's a LOT of them, I often wonder how I'm even still alive. In fact, most of the actions in my 25 years of existence have been missteps, simple mistakes that could've easily been avoided with better attention, calm awareness, and rational thinking. But what bothers me the most is, as I got older, and continued to make mistakes, even though I became smarter [at least I think I did] and became more aware that some of the actions I took or were about to take were not good choices, despite that, I still chose to make them anyway. I didn't care, I just wanted to feel good in the moment, I wasn't thinking about who would suffer [which was me most of the time] and what the consequences would be, I just wanted to be happy, even if it was for a very short amount of time, I wanted to at least pretend that I could have long lasting happiness in my life, whether it be in the form of games and toys I stole money for, rebelling against my elders because I didn't [and still don't] like being told what to do even though they only had my best interest at heart [at least i hope they did], seeking the company of unsavory, unkind, or immoral people because I wanted to feel acceptance so badly that I was willing to LITERALLY pay for it by buying them stuff, and seeking the companionship of animals, because I figured, At least they won't judge me for my weirdness. My weirdness' being my interests and demeanor. The only people I feel I've ever been able to be my true self around without fear of rejection are my online friends who share many similar problems with me when it comes to dealing with depression. My inability to effectively be around others in a public or a real life' setting without at some point driving them away stems from my insecurity and angst. Yea, a grown-ass 25 year old man has angst. Maybe other people my age do as well, but that's besides the point. First off, I'm a nerd, of epic proportions. I collect Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, watch cartoons, draw and buy comics, the works. But I'm smart enough to realize that those interests aren't enough to repulse 95% of the people I come into contact with. My insecurities are, however. These insecurities stem from my fear of being rejected due to my interests, which in turn, cause me to act like a complete ass to people because I believe they think lowly of me because I what I like. I figure, Well, they'll never see me as anything other than a loser, so fuck em, they don't deserve my respect. Yea, real smart thinking. Thinking which at some point, no matter what group of people I end up with, causes me to do and say very annoying, weird, and sometimes offensive things to them. And when I DO get rejected, it only fuels my insecurities and projections of other people looking down on me, causing me to become angry or frustrated. Not hard to see why I've never been able to keep or even have real friends for most of my life. Despite that, however, there are SOME people who have the good grace to put up with me and my stupidity. Ironically, these people usually tend to be very religious. I guess you would have to be blessed by the holy spirit to be able to endure my nonsense. Or maybe there's some truth to what Bill Burr once said, how assholes seek out wonderful people to be around because other assholes won't put up with them. And while I am more than grateful to have my best friend of 7 years in my life, the fear of losing them always lingers over my head, like its an eventuality with me, that I'll never be able to have a stable lasting relationship with another person. The majority of why I feel this way, I suppose, comes from my relationship with my family. Now let me say one thing before I go any further. I love my parents, and I love my siblings. And even though I don't agree with of like some of the choices they've made in life, that fact will never change. Then again, how can I say I love them when looking back on my actions in my youth, particularly between the ages of 7-15, and how horrible I was. As I mentioned before, I used to steal. A lot. Particularly from my father. I'd use the money to buy childish things to enjoy, not caring if I got caught, at least in the moment. I couldn't happiness from other people, I sought it in objects. I also used to beat up my siblings and say really mean things to them, probably because I got bullied a lot at school, and didn't know how to vent my aggression and anger. My little brother got it the worst. I'd pin him down, punch him, slam him into things, say horrible horrible things to and about him. My mother see this and say, What's wrong with you? Don't you realize your brother looks up to? Looking back, I really could've messed my brother up and helped him grow into an awful person like me. Luckily, my brother is smart, and knows not to follow in my dumbass footsteps. So do my sisters. Things weren't always bad between us, I still remember days when the 5 of us would just play together and not hurt each other. Funny enough, these days often involved us doing very stupid things for fun, like jumping off the roof, and or wars', in which we would grab anything that wasn't nailed down and hurl it at each others' heads. Still, the cruelty I showed towards them left an impression and later showed as we grew. The thing I regret the most was something I did when I was 13-14. In my youth [ages 4-5], I was a coward and sometimes called my dad to sleep in the bed with me when I had nightmares. Around my early teens, there was a night when my youngest sister, who was about 6-7 at the time, walked into my room and asked if she could stay in there, because she was afraid of the dark as well. I told her to grow and leave, to which she did, in a very saddened voice. My youngest sister asked me for help, help with something I suffered with as well and one point, and I flat out rejected her. Some brother I am. As we got older, I calmed down a bit and tried to form better relationships with my siblings, but they rejected me at every turn. Whenever I'm at work and talk about my siblings and people ask me if we're close, I smile and lie, saying yes. I can't blame them at all, I don't in anyway justify of defend my actions, but instead try to make sense of them to myself if no one else. Part of this aggression that I had [and still have somewhat] inside of me is likely not just from the schoolyard bullying I endured, but also the discipline I received from my father. I can remember as far back as my time in pre-K that he'd hit me. I can even remember the first time he struck me. He was trying to teach me to tie my shoes and I just couldn't seem to get it, so he smacked my hand with one of this shoes [he wore size 12s lol ouch]. The beatings would come mostly from my lack of good grades in elementary school. He would sometimes pick me up from school and bring me to bathroom of his office and spank me with his belt when I got a low mark. The worst 2 beatings I remember were when my mother was out of town and I tried to sneak up on my dad and scare him as a joke, to which he replied by chasing my to his closet where I tried to hide, and kicked me when he couldn't pull me out to spank me, and the other being when he hurled a chair at me when I was 8 for not bringing my books home from school. For a while I thought this was something every kid felt with when they got disciplined by their parents, but talking to other kids made me think otherwise. I can even remember being sent to therapists as a child, because my parents were so concerned with my grades that they thought I was mentally ill, and when therapists would ask me if i got spanked, I'd lie and say no, unknowingly doing so out of loyalty to my folks. I wasn't the only one who suffered my father's wrath. He later went on to slam my mother into a window for not aborting my youngest sister, a fact I would later use as fuel for a horrible comment I would tell my sister when we would fight, Dad never wanted you anyway. Christ, I'm a scumbag. My dad later had a stroke when I was 9, and died when I was 14. My mother, bless her heart, did and continues to do her best for all 5 of us. She's not perfect, but she loves us, even when she does some questionable things. There have been times when I would talk about how my father would discipline me and she would say things like, That never happened, and then would go on to say things like, If your father was here, he'd knock you on your ass, when I would disobey her or act out. My mother has a knack for getting under my skin, she knows just what to say to get my so angry that I have to leave the room or the house. Not surprising when she brags about how she was a bully in her youth. If there is a god, maybe me getting bullied so much is some sort of cruel irony thrust apron my mom by the vengeful spirit of god. Anywho, my mother later became the main disciplinary force in the household after my father was unable to do so due to his illness. It wasn't as bad as having it be my father though, 1 being due to the fact I was a teenager and much bigger at the point, and 2 her being a woman made the blows less painful as well. However, getting hit in your 20s usually doesn't prompt the same response as it did when you were 6. One day she tried to hit me for forgetting to do something small, I can't even remember, and when she swung, I blocked her hand and pushed her to the ground. And that was the day I got kicked out the house. I lived at my grandparents' for the next few years, until I eventually moved back to help my mother with her current problems. One thing i found very interesting is one day when my mother took me out for my 24th birthday, she asked about my future plans in life. Embarrassed because I didn't have any, I asked her, What did you want to do when you were my age? She simply replied, Find a safe place. This made me think back to all the stories my mother would tell me how she would endure physical and emotional abuse from her brother and mother. My grandfather, her father, and the best man I've ever known, thankfully, didn't inflict any abuse on her or her brother and sister. Thinking about that comment and my past, it troubles me to think that my mother likely believes to she failed in finding or making a safe place' for her and her children. Around the time I turned 17, I began to turn a new leaf. I wanted to have a good relationship with my family, I wanted friends, maybe a girlfriend, and respect from my peers. However, I soon realized in my idiocy in my younger years, I had missed out on learning social skills and had severely damaged my relationship with my family. And while I DID want to get better, I still continued make dumb decisions, like put off my studies and say mean things to my siblings. My family also said [and some still say] very demeaning things to me. So I trained myself I have no or very little reaction to them, even though they hurt. This indifferent demeanor I developed caused them and other people to see me as uncaring or cold. Despite my efforts however, I've often been told that I have resting angry face' or always look very serious or sad. I continued on, seeking help from people I found online who seemed to have similar issues with self-loathing and feeling like a failure. And after some serious soul-searching and looking back on all my missteps, it became apparent to me that my likelihood of finding another human being in real life I could truly do right by would be very unlikely. So, I turned to animals. I figured if I could at least do right by another living thing, that I wouldn't truly be evil. Because even if I cleaned up my act, changed my attitude about myself and other people completely, it wouldn't undo all the horrible things I did. But, if I could care for an animal, and never bring harm or allow harm to come to them, I could find a way to live myself. I began to invest most of my time at home with my dog, bringing him with me wherever I could, allowing him to live my room when I could and sleep next to me in bed. He's been with me for 10 years, and I love him like family. Recently, he ran away, which caused me to become very distraught. For 4 agonizing days, I get home from work and walk around the neighborhood and surrounding areas, shouting his name, looking for him in every space he could possibly be, asking people for possible tips and even offering a cask reward. I even sobbed when it occurred that I might never see him again, whether he got picked up by some random people, or was killed. The thought of me failing him was too much to bare. Luckily, he was returned to me safe an sound. But I began to think, what if he got out again? With my luck, he might be gone for good next time. I thought, Maybe if I get him a companion, something that'll help him WANT to stay home, he won't run off again. Which brings me to what prompted me to type this little essay on my stupid existence. A few weeks ago, I went to an ABC to get the addresses on my driver's license and state ID changed. I arrived there early, and saw there was a Petsmart across the street. I decided to go in, thinking I might find some good supplies for Deuce [my dog]. I found that this store not only sold pet supplies, but also offered pets for adoption. There were birds, lizards, turtles, fish, and cats. That's when I first saw them, my kittens, Sophie and Sapphire. Two small black kittens, curled up together in a cage against some glass. That's it! I thought. If I could just adopt these cats and introduce them to Deuce, he'd have companions. This, of course, was another awful decision on my part. Not only did I not have the first inkling on how to properly take care of kittens, but there was no way in hell my mother would allow MORE animals in her home. Despite me knowing this however, I chose to adopt them both a few days later [pursuit of happiness n all that]. I figured I'd learn how to take care of them and after having them in the house for a while without my mother knowing, and then revealing to her that they haven't made a mess, and also using the fact that I've been helping her ever since I moved back in with her, she'd allow me to keep them. Flawless logic, I know. Well, 1 the kittens DID make a mess, like one of my coworkers warned me they would, and 2, it didn't take long at all for my sister to discover them in my room. Right off the bat she told me, You need to tell mom soon, or I will. After doing my best to convince her to give me more time, I managed to clean up the mess made and plan my next move. Sophie and Sapphire had time to become well acquainted with me and my room in the 2 weeks they were there. I became quite fond of them as well. I hadn't had time to properly introduce them to Deuce however. He had flees at the time and it was recommended to me to keep the kittens away form other animals with flees and to slowly introduce them to other animals in the household. Then a realization dawned on me. What if my mother wouldn't let me keep them? What if they got sent back to the shelter they came from? What if they got separated? What if they were adopted by someone who wouldn't take good care of them or abuse them? I decided that if worse came worse, I'd find a new proper owner myself, someone I could stay in constant contact with, someone I'd interview myself to see if they'd take good care of the kittens. There were many takes, many were collage students who wanted one kitten for a companion. However, I desperately wanted to keep them together because they were sisters, and wanted them to at least have company if their owner didn't give them enough attention themselves. Then the day came, when my sister told my mother about the kittens in my room. I braced myself for the verbal lashing, the name calling, the curse words, everything I expected to happen after enduring it for so long after I went against my mother's demands. Then, to my utter shock, I got a text from my sister that said, Mom says you can keep them if you clean up the roach pills off the floor in the laundry room and put them in there. I couldn't believe it. Things were going to be alright, I could keep them, I could give them the care and home I promised to give them. Then, as if god himself decided to give me the finger, I got another text saying, The cats have got to go, they gave me ringworm. Then everything I feared would happen happened. What especially hurts about this was how my mother and sister assume that I don't care that my sister got sick from the cats, that I'd gladly risk their health by bringing animals home, that I care more about cats than them. I had no clue that the kittens were sick, and wouldn't have brought them home if I knew otherwise. And I would've also paid for any treatment my sister required. Despite that, they have every right to be angry with me. I was forced to find the kittens a new owner, someone who I thought would be a constant contact with me, but who is now unresponsive to me. I fear the worst for my cats. I'm probably being over dramatic again, but I can't help it. I hurt my family, again, due to my negligence and dishonesty, and I may have effectively hurt the lives of two animals. Every time I mess up, I always try to piece together what led me to make such horrible choices. I don't know how I became so broken that I can't have stable relationships with people, or make choices that don't end up hurting someone or something. Its getting to the point where I don't even want to know the answer anymore, the answer that might've led me down the path to fixing myself. I just want it all to end, I'm tired of to trying to deny that I'm a horrible person, someone who doesn't deserve to live. I know for a fact that if I just disappeared, so many people's lives would be better for it. But right now, Deuce still depends on me, and I want at least help my mother with her current problem, which SHOULD be solved in the next few months. But after I'm no longer needed, I can't see any real point in sticking around. Ever since I was a child, the idea of killing myself has been in my head, even before I became aware of the concept of suicide. I would look over bridges I'd walk over or be driven over, thinking what it be like if I just threw myself off. Would it be painful? Would I not have to deal with people anymore? Would I be missed? Being older now, I'm pretty sure I know the answers to the questions, yet, it still doesn't me from those thoughts. I'm sorry to my family for being such a monster, I wish I could've known sooner how I should've acted, I wish I could've seen how my awfulness would've effected you in the years to come. You all are truly the most important people in my life, and I don't want to hurt you. I'm sorry to Sophie and Sapphire, I wanted to give you a loving home, but do to my dishonesty, I was able to do that, I let you both down. Maybe if I had been honest in the beginning, you'd be home with me right now, and not with some stranger who I foolishly trusted to care for you. And to all the people who are or who tried to be my friends, I'm sorry to all of you for being so unbearable. You deserve a better friend than me, and if you chose to walk away from me now, I wouldn't hold it against you at all, cuz I'd walk away from me too.",1

"Somewhere on the Internet a few years ago I read that the probability of coming into existence is 1 in 400 trillion, I'm the result of thousands of people having sex with the right person at the right time for me to come into existence, one small detail 100.000 or 25 years ago could've made my existence impossible. While I know that my life is a miracle, I can't help but think of suicide. I've been suffering from chronic depression forever. My life is an ocean of sadness, I always tried to keep on being positive when one day: it was raining, I was looking out the window, my boyfriend and I stayed home. We both took a day off from work. I was thinking of how lonely, sad, unfulfilled and hopeless I was feeling, despite being loved, despite having the perfect family, a really good-looking guy who loved me, good friends... but I still felt unfulfilled and empty. I broke up with him, that was the moment I gave up on my optimism, from that moment I became hard to be around, and our relationship ended. I still have my friends who are aware of my condition, they respect the fact that I'm not always in the right mood to try to have fun and go out, but I feel lonely... hopeless. Nothing keeps me happy. You know, life is a miracle yes, but sometimes one just runs out of resources for coping with the pain. Think of life like a business in this case: when there are no resources to keep it going, all you have to do is give up on it. I don't want to live anymore. Yesterday I spent my Saturday night at home, and I looked out of the window... I didn't jump because I didn't feel ready but the thought of it didn't really scare me at all, it was actually comforting. I think I'll do it in three months, I have a date, I won't regret '' shutting my business down ''.",1

"sorry if this is hard to make sense of, I feel like I don't know anything anymore.
I was 8 years old when my parents got divorced, from then on until I turned 13 and had the courage to not go back to my father's house, I was physically abused half the time I was there. Always for no real reason. I found out that he was into BDSM shit like that, and I don't know what to think of those years now knowing this.
Anyways, all I can remember from my childhood is traumatizing shit, and the stuff that isn't, I don't even know if it actually happened or it's just a dream or my head just making shit up. I'm young I guess, still in highschool. 10th grade. Last year was horrible, I would be crying every other day in class just from not knowing anything and from what I would think others would think of me. I changed schools after first semester, didn't show up for almost 3 months and failed all but 1 class. I wasn't in a good place. Constant delusions, couldn't justify keeping up with basic hygiene unless I had to see someone who probably knew me, because I didn't want anyone judging me for any reason. One of the nurses or whoever at the second school brought something up which led to me having a panic attack, to them calling my mother and practically forcing me to admit what happened back then. My mother didn't care about it. Assuming it was just nothing, and proceeded to yell at me over failing classes.
I had one close friend then a couple others who I'd talk with on a regular basis, but I recently moved almost 900 miles away and I can feel that the internet won't keep those friendships together.
I have no friends at my current school, and since I've been here we have only had enough money to get by. Everyone else here isn't like that.
I feel scared to say anything at my school since there are papers hung ALL OVER the place about suicide and I heard a classmate talking about how she's going to report another girl at my school because of her being depressed. And I feel like I can't say anything to my mother or her fiance because I feel like they'd just tell me to get over this. I tried talking to two of my old friends (~900 miles away) about a little bit of how I've been feeling/thinking and the only response I got was that I'm ""crazy"".
Since February I've gone pretty much every day just overall thinking of suicide and simply not being here. I don't see any point in living besides I don't want to possibly hurt anyone because of it in the future.
I would attempt to get help if I could, but I don't know how.
P.S.: mentioning that others have it worse doesn't help.

"Sorry if this is the wrong place, wrong topic, or wrong crowd. This is my first Reddit post I've ever made, and I'm just hoping to find a voice and some echoes back in the darkness. I don't actually post online in general, but I am aware of trigger warnings and how seriously people take them, so, uh, obviously trigger warning about suicidal thoughts, and also self-harm, and pretty much every kind of abuse.TL;DR: Long history of abuse, have never emotionally worked it out, doctor re-traumatized me very recently, this became an opportunity to connect with my therapist on a level where I could trust him enough to finally address old pain, until he realized he made a mistake, had to break my trust and do the one thing I was trying to avoid. Now I feel crushed and a sense of futility and am making stupid risky choices that could kill me, but not committing to a proper suicide plan. What's going on with me? Am I suicidal, or something else?TL:
I don't know if I am actually suicidal, crying for help, looking for attention, overreacting, or what. I cannot commit to fully going through with it, so I feel like I still have hope. I somehow always find hope. But I am also hurting so deeply and feel like it will never get better, and am starting to obsess about the release of death. I have a way planned out to do it, should I ever fully commit to it. It's one of those things that I do not want to mess up. And the way I have 'planned' out is simple, requires little preparation or supplies, is easily accessible, and is practically foolproof. Basically, I have no excuse not to do it 'right,' at any time of my choosing, if I actually choose to kill myself at all. But I'm not there yet.What I have been doing is going to sleep most nights on a handful of random prescription meds and some shots of tequila. It was mostly last week, and it was mostly combinations I felt very confident would cause me no long-term harm. Why do I mix them at all? I suppose it satisfies some burning need for self-destruction, especially lately since I have been hurting deeply.The thing is, there were at least two nights last week, and especially one, where I flat out took a couple combinations of medications that are known to be fatal. And I didn't just take the doses I was prescribed...I took double, or triple, or quadruple on some pills. Then I added a bunch more pills, just 'cause - especially if they had obvious warnings about interactions with alcohol. Then of course I took a few shots of tequila. Then I took more pills. I recall thinking to myself, 'well, this may ACTUALLY kill me this time. Hell, by all rights it probably will.' I had survived taking the base combination of meds before, but only at single doses of each, or double-dose at most. And that was back when I was taking a LOT of meds, and had quite the tolerance. And I'd never mixed them with some of the things I did this time, which only enhanced the danger and chances of dying. And I totally knew what I was doing, and that - not only was there a CHANCE I could die, but by that point, a likelihood. And I went to bed feeling great. Light. Peaceful. I guess in my mind, I saw it as all of the advantages of suicide, and all of the advantages of an accident, which sounds terrible but is what it is. Some stubborn part of me doesn't want to admit defeat and choose to kill myself. Some part of me doesn't want my friends, few though they are, to think I wanted to do that to them. Some part of me still has hope, but I don't know why because I seriously have every ounce of hope crushed in my life somehow. The rest of me is exhausted, and really really hurting, and tired of trying my hardest and being defeated at every step. And those parts of me figured this was great - I would go to bed feeling calm and peaceful and guilt-free, because I 'legitimately' (in my mind) was not TRYING to kill myself, and I wasn't sure if I was going to die, so I would either never wake up and never know any better, and all of my problems would be solved without any of the guilt or misery of 'real' suicide, and my friends could wonder what made me so airheaded that night that I OD'd, instead of what made me so miserable that night that night that I killed myself. Or, I would wake up, still be alive, and not be any worse off than I was the night before, and maybe even wake up with a newfound sense of appreciation for life. Spoiler alert: I lived, sans new appreciation for life.Now I am at a crossroads. I am out of all of the meds I used in the heavy-hitter nights, so I really don't think I have any meds I could take - even with alcohol - to accidentally kill me. But I'm still fantasizing about it, and obsessing about it. The more nights I go without some crazy OD, the more planning I do for my real life plans of suicide (updating my will, planning accommodations, etc). I suppose now is a good time to mention that I am taking antidepressants, and I regularly see a therapist. I really like my therapist, and I have been open with him so far about everything - even about the overdose of pills, even though I really didn't want to admit it. He's a good guy, and I have a lot of respect for him. There's just one problem right now...It starts with my doctor, who I am no longer seeing. The TL;DR on that is he screwed up big time, said things tailor-fit to fuck me up (eg suggestions that I was 'asking' for sexual abuse as a toddler, shouldn't legally pursue the people who gang-raped me when I was 12 because they probably thought they were doing me a favor, and concerns that I was delusional and imagining present day porn into my past...and it just goes on). And of course, despite outright telling him I did not want to have sexual contact with him, he came onto me. I was in the middle of trying to finalize a very tricky diagnosis, so I'll admit that I let that continue for weeks because I was too afraid to lose progress. The good news is after four years of fighting, I finally got a diagnosis. The bad news is I'm dying. Win some, lose some?I finally told my therapist about what was happening, under his word that it would remain in complete confidence and he would not have to report it. Telling him was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I can talk about my childhood trauma without batting an eye, but this was different. This made me feel vulnerable, and I took every ounce of trust and faith I had, and for the first time in my life, I allowed myself to put that in someone else's hands. It may seem like a minor thing to talk about, but for me, it was both symbolically and literally the hardest, most personal, scariest, and most meaningful thing I have ever told someone. It became the biggest weight I have ever felt lifted off of me. As we continued to talk about it, I found two things were happening:I was feeling a lot more confident, and my sense of self-worth was going back up. I started considering reporting my doctor because what he did was wrong, and I did not want others to get hurt.I was feeling much more connected to my therapist. Our confidence started opening emotional connections I've been lacking all my life, with others and within myself. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to make the connection I so desperately needed to finally confront the bigger stuff from my past, and also to finally have autonomy and feel empowered in standing up to an abusive situation (with my doctor) that had recurred all too many times in my life. It was a second chance to turn the fate of a recurring abusive scenario from my past around. so I was empowered, AND an opportunity to FINALLY, after decades of desperate soul-searching, tap into everything holding me back from confronting my demons and finally having closure in my life, especially before I die. That trust and that connection became the most precious, rare, and important thing I'd ever had in my life. I know that may sound pathetic to a lot of you, but understand that in my life, it is literally a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing.For the first time since my flashback and depression hit, I felt true hope, energy, and empowerment for my future, and for my future work. I'd never been able to have the kind of trust needed to delve into the emotions attached to my childhood trauma, but here it seemed to finally be developing all on its own. It was literally the first time in my life I felt like I stood a chance of tackling those issues - which is more important to me than ever, since I want to reclaim them as part of my life before I go, and frankly my time is ticking.I got the gut feeling that it was time to take action against my doctor. I marched into my therapist's office feeling strong. I knew it would suck, but I was ready to take it on, and it was my choice, and I knew he would be supportive. So, of course, before I said anything that day, he opened with an update that he had since realized he'd been wrong about the reporting requirements, that it was an honest oversight, that he'd tried everything he could to keep his end of the bargain, but that he had to break trust and was required to report the incident. To his credit, he was transparent about it, did everything he could to work around it, and then did everything he could to make sure it wouldn't happen to anyone else. To my credit, that doesn't make me hurt any less.I know it seems silly. You might say, 'well you were going to report him anyway, so what does it matter?' and I'd even be inclined to agree. I think what is killing me is, the issue of trust - it was really, REALLY hard for me to trust my therapist, and relying on that trust and telling him was the hardest thing I've had to do, and the most trust I had to extend, since I was a small child. It was really, really meaningful to me, so even symbolically, breaking that trust is heartbreaking. Secondly, his mandatory reporting takes away my autonomy. If I changed my mind and decided not to report it, for whatever reason, it would no longer be my choice. And finally, in a few words it erased that feeling of emotional connection and trust I finally had, for the first time in my life, to work on these horribly traumatic issues I've had bottled up since I was old enough to have memories. To lose that...there are no words.I don't know what to do. I'd like to think that we can work through this. I know he is genuinely remorseful, and that it was an honest mistake. But I also know he doesn't seem to understand how big of a deal it is to me, or that it was opening up my trust to my bigger issues. In fact, he kept trying to convince me that my outburst of hurt and pain was really just a transference of the pain I was feeling from being traumatized by my doctor. That might have been one of the most hopeless feeling moments in my life.I don't want to see another therapist. I don't think a different therapist will be any better. If anything, I'll just lose the trust and work I've established with my current therapist. And the trust that we built is not something that can just come from talking to someone. I stand just as much a chance of getting it back from him as I do getting it in the first place with someone else - IF I ever get it again. But I'm in my 30s, and that is the first time IN. MY. LIFE. that I felt that opening up, despite years of therapy, positive attitudes, success with life, and all of the right circumstances to have tapped it before now. It was a miracle I had the chance to get there once, and that happened because of a freak trauma that I HOPE to not have to repeat with anyone else again. So, here I am. In the middle of the night, on Reddit, typing my first post, which is embarrasingly long (and this is the short version), looking at my bottle of tequila, knowing I have to go to work tomorrow and put my brain full-force into intense thinky work things, wanting nothing more than to feel the pleasant floaty buzz of a drink and a few muscle relaxants, and maybe not wake up, ever again, and not have to try to explain to my therapist again that, I'm sorry, even though you weren't the bad guy here, what you did is really the thing that is hurting me, and I don't know that I will ever recover, which means I don't know that I will ever go on to accomplish my goals before I die. And the more I keep trying and failing like I have the rest of my life, the more it's just going to feel painful and empty in the end. And it's a sobering thought.So then I soberly think about whether I'm ready to go through with my full-fledged suicide plan, or whether I'm willing to risk what is left of my hope (almost none) and my fighting spirit (all but burnt out) on some pipe dream of regaining this elusive sense of trust that only ever materialized from a traumatic anomaly, or whether I'm still stuck on tequila and prescription meds. And whether I'm suicidal at all.Thanks for listening, and for making it this far.",1
"Sorry if this thread is all over the place i'm just really not sure what to do... I really hate my life. I suffer from severe depression and social anxiety but have to put on a fake smile everyday for family. Recently everyday I have thoughts of suicide but have never been able to actually bring myself to do it. I guess I feel a bit guilty as both my parents have been diagnosed with cancer and I don't feel I have a right to end my life. My dad had bowel cancer from Mid 2016 but has had surgery and is doing well. We then found out Jan 2016 that my mum had leukemia and is currently still going through treatment but is doing good.This however is not when my depression began, I was sexually abused as a child in another country (my family used to go once every few years) by my cousin on multiple occasions and ended up hating going to the country but to this day I have not told my parents why.
I was then bullied everyday in school for 5 years. I dreaded going on lunch breaks...sometimes I used to go to the library and pretend to read books just so that I could stay somewhere I wouldn't be punched or kicked.   After finishing uni, I started an IT job which I liked at the beginning but 2 years later the job turned crap and I vowed to leave for a better job. This was the time I had found out my mum had cancer too and I quit my job to care for her and my dad but they were not too happy as they'd rather I worked that sit at home (This was about May 2017). I decided to look for another job in August 2017 and found another job but I absolutely hate it. I don't really want to quit it as I've just started and want to give it a chance. I have been to the doctors about my depression and they gave me a different anti depressants to try which worked, but in early 2017 I decided to stop taking them as I didn't want to rely on medication my whole life. They referred me to a psychology team but as I had to arrange for an appointment myself I just couldn't bring myself to it as I feel embarrassed and ashamed to talk about my past life.I don't really have any best friends to talk to deeply about this as they either do not know what to say, they think i'm lying about being depressed or they say you should talk to someone. I've rambled on but I just don't know why I really really do not like my life. I have thought about ways to kill myself but just cannot do it. I'm scared.  ",0

"Started uni this fall and it's really stressful and I have no goals with my education so nothings really motivating me. I really like the subject but it's just not worth the effort.

I guess I forgot that even if those people existed I wouldn't get along because I barely open my mouth unless someone is asking me questions.

"Starter note, I will likely not kill myself, I have strong ties to a dear friend who died, and it was the worst experience of my life. I would never wish this feeling upon anyone. His 21st birthday is soon, so death thoughts of course appear amidst the despair.But recently I was at a friends party, and I just couldn't deal with being there. I spent the entire time sitting in a corner alone. I was just too worried about too much other shit that was going on for me to enjoy it. But for some reason, as I looked out the window with T balloon weights next to me for some reason I kept having thoughts of grabbing the rock, smashing the glass, and then ramming a large shard into my throat. (As a note, I used to be a very violent person til this friends death. I bit many people during primary school, it was not pleasant)I was mostly scared of myself for thinking these things. I just hate being by myself because I keep thinking this sort of thing and panicking.

Just thought it was weird, seeing as I still broke it)",0
"Starting in middle school, I stopped wanting to be alive. That drive for new experiences, for interaction, that happiness, died with my best friend when she hung herself. I'm not angry with her for what she did. I understand why she did it. I'm angry at everything that's happened since then. The people who made me feel guilty for it and blamed me. All the suicides and attempts from the people I loved. I lost three people to suicide. Five of them never succeeded. It will take too much for me to write out everything that's led me here for the past seven years. I just recently graduated high school and started college. I've spent so long hurting that I don't know what happy feels like. A couple years before I lost my friend, I started dating my boyfriend, who I'm still with today. He's a big part of why I'm still holding on. I guess I've just made the realization that nothing I'm doing is really for me. I don't actually have anywhere in life I want to go.  I don't have a goal. Any passion. I'm just doing everything in the order that everyone is telling me I'm supposed to do things in. Graduate. Get a job. Start college. Move out. I'm so lonely. I'm not really staying for any other reason than the fact that I've had to see what suicide does to the people left behind so many times. I love my boyfriend so much. I love my mom. I love my friends. But it's just not enough to stay. I'm only here so they don't have to feel that pain I've had to feel so many times. I hate thinking about what happens after they find me. My parents having to outlive two children. My boyfriend breaking down every time he sees our photos and all the things we've made for each other these past seven years. My friend having to cope with losing her dad and me the same way. It hurts so bad to think about. I spent a year in therapy, and was switched around different anti depressants for that time. Nothing worked. I just stopped showing up.I don't really know why I'm writing this. I'm just hurting and I don't want to be here but I know I can't go through with it. Please help me.",1

"suicide just seems like such an appealing option. There's a laundry list of reasons why I'm drawn to it - I feel broken, bored, alone, etc - and the list is constantly morphing. After perusing this subreddit for only a day, I feel like y'all would understand. I could expound on the why, but that would require an entire essay. And this is my first post (be gentle, etc), so I'll try to keep it short. I'll give some context. I hate admitting this, but my fickle depression stems, in part, from the women I've loved in my life, and losing them almost entirely due to my own nature. It is exacerbated when my mind wanders to them, either randomly or via reminders e.g. Snapchat stories on Labor Day Weekend (LDW). I can elaborate if anyone cares, but I'm not really looking for anyone to care, just for a space in which I can babble about my current feelings. Because fleshing my thoughts out has always been therapeutic for me to some extent, and reading this subreddit has made me realize that perhaps it can be therapeutic for some of you, in a solidarity sort of way.And honestly, that vague sense of solidarity has been getting me through tonight. I'm a medical student currently on 24 hour surgery call (by virtue of being in medical school alone, I realize I am incredibly fortunate - a piece of the whole ""my life is objectively great""). I feel absolutely amazing when I get involved in patient care - it's almost like a drug. But just like most drugs, withdrawal is a bitch. Every weeknight I go back home & curl up in bed alone, finding solace in mentally orchestrating my own death until I fall asleep. So right now I'm in a weird place. It's a slow LDW Saturday at the hospital and I'm not really needed anywhere. I haven't done anything for a couple hours now, and my mind is starting to wander into the usual dark places - but this time, it's happening in my one safe haven. The idea of getting through medical school so I can devote my life to patient care is one of the few reasons I persist. If I lose this, if this sanctuary gets tainted by my misaligned & maladaptive thoughts, then what am I left with?",1

"Suicide or rather death is nice dream to me, I guess since I grew up going to a christian school the whole notion of dust to dust ashes to ashes seems like somewhat of a cathartic experience, ya know full circle type of shit.  I can't say I've lived a hard or troubled life, I never went without or experienced struggle the likes that a great majority have.  I went to a good school got good grades had plenty of extracurriculars and got into a great college on scholarship which I proceeded to flunk out of because I never showed up to class.  The problem is or rather MY problem is that I've never given a shit about anything in life ever.  That last sentence isn't entirely true I guess if I have to put it into words my life's goal has never been to improve or change anything or anyone's life, it's been to be a net zero.  It was always easier to do well because no one would hassle me.  I like the easy way out even if it means a little bit of work(weird rationalization, I know).  I want to fade into nothingness.  I don't want to be remembered, I don't want any trace of my life to ever exist.  At this point in my life I'd rather be dead than to drag those around me down with my carefree wanton lifestyle because it's probably depressing for others to watch my life implode by my own hand.  To those wondering about mental health shit, I'm not depressed, I kind of have an awesome life.  I do have schizophrenia or rather I was diagnosed with it though I haven't taken medication in over 8 months as I've had no signs or inklings of it.  Schizophrenia was freaky at first and to be honest I flipped the fuck out straight 5150 status but once I understood what was going on in my head the shit was easy to rationalize, compartmentalize, and control.  Aside from some legal trouble i.e. alcohol related due to poor impulse control because yea I want to die, my life is pretty dope. Life seems like a colossal waste of time that only drudges on to make me feel even worse about the shit I've done, the people I've disappointed, and the relationships I've ruined via utter apathy.  Maybe this isn't the right place to express my feelings but as much as I would love to commit suicide, it's too much work for nothing.  I gain nothing by killing myself other than reliving the burden that being part of a society entails.  Call me greedy, selfish, short-sighted or whatever you want but life has no meaning to me aside from suffering.  We all will die someday unless there are cyborgs so what's wrong with speeding the hands of Father Time up a bit.  I'm but one drop in the bucket out of over six billion, who cares, life is cruel sadistic joke, I guess the greeks had it right about Sisyphus.  I don't know whether it's right to continue living a tortured existence where I'm only bound to cause more long term hurt to those around me or in one swift action cause immediate pain that will subside over time.  I feel like a cancer to those around me.  I'm at an impasse somewhat wishing I was standing on an overpass except knowing my luck I'd land on a prius.",1

"Suicide, yeah. I wanna die. I wake up and I'm upset that my eyes opened again. Everything I liked has become so insignificant to me in the past few years and life is just a hassle all the time. Y'know, I understand people have their problems, that there's gonna be obstacles pretty often, but I'm here thinking, ""Wow, fuck this. What's the point?"" I'm only 21, I'm a full time student who is also employed, I'm pursuing the career I want - but a big part of me tells me none of what I want will ever happen.
I'm a girl, and I hate it; this culture is so shitty toward this gender and it takes absolutely everything in me to not reek havoc on society every motherfucking day. Men look at me like they want to eat me and I'm just so uncomfortable walking down the street. I can't even work without a gross older man looking me up and down and flirting with me. My skin crawls every time.... gah
People tell me they are here for me but I cannot bring myself to talk with them. I don't want to be hospitalized because that's gonna put everything (like SCHOOL) on hold, and I don't want that. It's like there are solutions but I cannot use them.
Things aren't going so well right now. My future is at risk because of a stupid decision I made to ""help"" with my depression - but now consequences are obviously not worth it and I'm pushed to seriously kill myself because I'm prone to make stupid decisions ALL THE TIME just fuck me, right? I should googogogoGO...but I'm here.",0
"Suicide. I CAN NOT stop thinking about it. Ways to do it, how it would feel, the relief of finally having some blood pump through my veins right before I hit the ground. I'm so bored and unhappy with my life that the act of ending it would be the only thing to provide sufficient excitement. I'm depressed and have been since 17. The fact is I don't feel anything at all except empty boredom. I'm on autopilot and want to die. I don't even know if I'd consider myself unhappy. Happy and sad are emotions and I am completely void of emotion.Found this subreddit after weeks of obsessing over it.I think I'll flip a coin.",0

"Thank you people so much for the support. I was off of my meds for a week  because they ran out and my mother was overseas for work, which is so why I was looking after the puppies.They were born in the very early morning and I checked on them every 1,5 hours the whole day, at about 2 or something in the next morning I left the mom dog with the babies while I went to wash my hands. When I came back she had bitten the really badly. She was holding it by what was left of it's head and I completely freaked out and instantly blamed myself. I know I did my best, we already decided this dog isn't getting anymore puppies, she was also aggressive towards the last litter.The sad thing is, she bit the other one as well, the other puppy was defecating blood throughout the day and died in my hands while I was crying and begging for it to have a better life than this one.For those concerned, I had to look after the puppies because my mom breeds with yorkies and when the mom was close to being due, she had to go on an important work trip across the world. In this time I ran out of medication and couldn't get until she came back and I was entrusted to look after the puppies. I'm on my medication again for those wondering. Thank you for the supportAlso sorry if anything is weird, English isn't my main language",1
"Thanks for giving me your precious time.
I'm an Asian that was raised born in Saudi Arabia in a fairly strict Muslim household. I was living ""normally"" until in 2015 I began questioning my faith, Islam. It was recently 9 months ago where I had the courage to completely renounce it.Now, I feel depressed and oppressed. Because I look different, I've always been bullied by the local kids for my looks from elementary to highschool, both verbally and physically. I'm also Bisexual, which makes it all the worse. So I'm living as an in-closet atheist and bi. Why not come out?Because I'd be given the death sentence if they found out, that if my own family didn't kill me first.Even with all that, I had managed to always ace my exams and top my classes. I even got enrolled into Medicine and got a perfect GPA(5/5) in my first year at the university. But then, slowly, I fell into depression and my grades suffered a lot. My GPA went all the way down to 3.1/5 and I even failed a whole year. You can imagine what an Asian parent would do if their child failed at college.I'm positive that both my parents are narcissists.
My mom keeps telling me that she ""owns"" me because she gave birth to me. My dad took away all my savings(over 2k$) because in Islam it's permissible to do that. There's an Islamic script(Hadith) allowing it: You and your wealth belong to your father, narrated by Abu Dawood (3530) and Ahmad (6640) . But I secretly opened a bank account and started over from the beginning. Although I don't have much in it right now..And my mom has been forcing me to go to the mosque 5 times a day, everyday. I've been putting up with it for so long and i can't take it any longer. She even forbid me from listening to music..My chest is heavy all the time except while spending time with my friends. I have a few good IRL's and a bunch of internet friends that keep me in check. I really wish if I could run away..
My original plan was to finish medicine, and use my degree to work somewhere else. But that'd take up to 6 years.. And I don't think I can pass it in my current mental state anyways.Please, if you know a way for me to move out and run away tell me about it. I really need it. Thanks.",1

"That is what I am. No matter how hard I try or what I achieve, death still seems convincing and I would not hesitate to shoot myself in the heart if I found a gun. I cannot change my mental state since misanthropy and antinatalism is the truth. I hate humanity, the system, fucking everything. Fuck the bullshit permanent solution to a temporary problem. Existence is my problem. It is stupid that I exist to make my family happy. I do not have free will. I am born by chance and am just another parasite like everyone else. Non existence is freedom because there is nothing to look forward to. No more enslavement by others nor being commanded like some dog. Life is nothing more but being a puppet on strings. You cannot suffer, feel pain, starve, or even hurt when you never existed. That to me is freedom. I will get there someday.",1

"That's it. I'm scared I'm going to do it. I still make throwaways when I post here because I'm scared about someone finding out who I really am but now there's a part of me that hopes someone does. I've given up on life. After 7 years waiting for ""it to get better"" I'm drained. I feel empty. Sure there are short periods where I feel ok, but pushing my way through every day with a feeling of complete worthlessness has depleted me. I used to say the only thing keeping me from killing myself was my old dog and best friend. He's been dead for 6 months and 5 days now. I'm scared.",1
"That's where I'm at right now as I write this. I've been depressed for years now, but the depression this time is different, stronger. I don't really feel down, I just feel empty, drained of everything that was ever considered me. I rarely 'feel' anything anymore, or at least I no longer know how or what to feel. Things I used to enjoy I can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of. I have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and I only do things because I'm obligated to. My personality is gone as well and the feelings I've had for those close to me are no longer there. When I call my dad or mom I feel nothing. I don't feel like myself anymore and I have no idea who I am anymore. I just feel like a ghost crudely occupying and controlling a fleshy shell. I mean, there are times when my legs or my hands don't feel like mine. My cognitive ability is completely shot as well and I can barely remember things more than a day's past. Just typing this is an ordeal, constant spelling mistakes and typos.On top of all this, I have no one to talk to. I have no friends to talk to. Sure, my Facebook profile says otherwise, but I never talk to any of them online, let alone IRL. I can't even tell my family because I know all they'll do is worry and try to fruitlessly help. I mean, I sometimes go so long without talking to someone that I will forget how to speak properly, even with people I know quite well. I wish I had someone I could talk to on a regular basis, but I've realized this will never happen because I always end driving people away for one reason another, be it my personality and mannerisms, or just because they found something better. Some say a therapist or counselor might help, but they never have for me. The problem is myself. I'm physically repulsive. I've seen the way people look at me and the way they behave around me. I mean, who wants to be seen talking to a fat, greasy, pizza faced, creeper-stache monster with a sweat problem? Even if they can get past that outer shell, what they find isn't any better. I'm a dull person. The things that interest me typically don't interest others and vice versa. My personality and interests just aren't compatible with most people. And even with people that share the same interests I usually end up screwing things up by doing something stupid, or something about me drives them away.And for those that are close to me I feel like an inconvenience. Maybe not so much a burden, but just one of those people where others go, ""Oh, here comes THAT guy again. Quick, let's think of a reason not to hang out with him."" FFS, I even feel this way with complete strangers. When I'm crossing the road, buying groceries, riding the bus, or just simply standing around. I just get this sense that people wish I weren't there. That if I weren't, their day would be 100% better.I'm also an addict, or rather becoming one. For years I was addicted to sleeping pills and benzos, anything that would knock me out and numb the mental pain. Then I was diagnosed with HPPD and I stopped for awhile. Then I became addicted to benzos again and I started drinking. I managed to kick those for a few months, but now I'm back at it. Every night I find myself drinking or experimenting with some new benzo. Anyways I feel like I'm rambling a bit. I guess if anything could stop me from doing what I'm planning on doing, it would be if I could have myself back and someone close to talk to. I want the old me back, the me that had friends and enjoyed things like playing guitar or staying up until 5am to figure out a bug in some code. And I wish I had someone I could talk to about how I feel. Because I don't have someone to talk to, I just keep things in and never let them out and I think I finally broke whatever was inside of me by doing so. Some might say get a therapist, but I've tried in the past and it just doesn't feel genuine enough. I need a friend, not a therapist. Some might also say to call up some old buddies from high school, but again, I feel like I'm such an inconvenience to them. Anyways, come Wednesday night (I have some things I need to take care of on Monday and Tuesday, some final preparations) I'll finally be done with this. It's not that I'm in any sort of emotional or psychological pain, it's just that I'm tired of not feeling, tired of feeling like an empty shell. Unless a miracle happens between now and then, there's no stopping me now. I've gathered my materials and made my preparations. I'm just putting this here because I felt like I should at least get these things off my chest.",0

However I've never been able to shake the feeling that I ruined their lives too when this whole thing happened. I've been living with this guilt that I turned my family's lives upside down forever. This didn't help when I turned to suicide as my only option at the age of 14. Between 14 and 21 I overdosed 6 times all failing evidently. I'm 25 now and objectively have a a good life.

"The void is growing bigger. It used to hit in waves but now it's always there, ever present and unrelenting. It pulls me towards the emptiness like a flame draws a moth. The Emptiness. The knowledge that nothing lasts forever used to give me hope. Hope was all that I had to keep me going. This can't last forever right? Nothing can! But that's not where I stand today. Today I stand at the precipice. The edge of the cliff. But the urge to jump isn't from L'appel du vide. It's from deeper inside than that. The void. It pushes me to the brink and tries to nudge me that last little bit. Hope held it back. Hope was my mighty defender, my protector, my savior from the void. But hope can't last forever either. Nothing can! Hope is dead and I'm left to fight the void by myself. I did it once before. Fueling my battle with the rage of a berserker. A furious vengeance behind every strike and blow. But I'm not angry this time, I'm nothing. I'm cold and empty and I feel like the void has already won. I see the emptiness and I think it can be the end of my struggle. Peace. What does that even mean? It's even foreign to me as an intellectual concept. It's not something I have any experience with so I wonder if it's even real. It sounds like it would be fun to try. To wake up without the void pulling at my brain. For my heart not to ache with every beat. 34 years now I've walked this earth and for 34 years I've felt lost among it. Always searching for my place, my home. I thought I found it several times along the way but that couldn't last forever right? Nothing can! People grow and change and the sad truth is they always grow away from me. No one has ever grown towards me. Perhaps that's the greatest tragedy in life. The ability to make such deeply rooted connections to others only to watch as they eventually decay into nothingness. Emptiness. There's that call again, and I feel the prodding finger of the void and the callous whisper at my ear. A moonlit serenade performed just for me and offering the seduction of every promise and wish I have fullfilled. Peace. Serenity. But could it last forever? Nothing can! Perhaps if I look hard enough I can find some Hope laying around, discarded from a mind weaker than my own that gave in on this very precipice in days lost to time. Perhaps this bit of Hope can connect with me and maybe something can grow towards me and away from everyone else. We could work together as protectors and defenders of each other. Two-way saviors working hand-in-hand to battle the void back, and maybe it would last forever! Oh wait Nothing Can!",0

The first is that I don't want my mom to outlive me - she's been through so much and worked so hard to be happy, that I absolutely can't kill myself while she's alive. I couldn't do that to her. So that's reason #1.Reason #2 is ridiculous. I feel like I can't kill myself until I've done something worthwhile. Until I've succeeded at accomplishing something notable - publishing a bestseller, making a million in the stock market, whatever. Something that justifies the fact that for a brief moment, I was alive. Only when I've found that peace will I be able to die. I absolutely refuse to kill myself now and die a failure. I'd be fine killing myself if I were successful. And there's that tiny sliver of hope, an irrational hope, trying to keep me alive by refusing to let me succeed.

"There's a group whatsapp chat between me and my three best friends. I'm going to give them pseudonyms to preserve their identity. We have Shayla (me), Gertrude and Camille. Camille has been clinically depressed for a couple years now. Since early last year, on multiple occasions, she has texted suicidal ""goodbye"" messages to the group, thanking us for all we've done for her, but saying she's made up her mind and she wants to end her life, even though she knows it's a selfish thing to do. Now of course we lose our fucking shit every time and go into a panic attack. Because we never know if she's just saying it, or if she's actually going to do it. So here's the thing. Every time she says she's going to kill herself, she never actually does it, and wakes up the next morning apologising and saying she felt ""posessed"" when she texted us the suicidal messages.This has happened at least five times. But frankly speaking, this cycle of staying up til morning to make sure she's fine and doesn't do anything stupid is extremely EXHAUSTING. Because I live near her, I end up rushing to her house to make sure she doesn't do anything stupid. Everyone kind of knows she isn't going to do it but nobody wants to take chances either.So here's where the disagreements start. I've decided that the next time Camille sends us a ""I'm going to kill myself, I love you all and thank you for all you've done"" I'm going to call the fucking police. I don't give a shit if she hates me for it, or if she decides to cut me out of her life. A mad friend is always better than a dead friend, and I don't want to be responsible for her death, and know that I made an assumption that she wouldn't kill herself, but ended up doing it anyway. Now Gertrude, the other friend, is telling me I shouldn't. She says leaping to call the police is not a good idea. She says I should find out more information first, then decide to make the phone call. Her stand is that we should personally would talk to her more and try to assess how serious she is, rather than leaping to dial, because we're not experts. Gertrude believes that bringing the police in will potentially make things more complicated for everyone including us, her parents and her family. Now the part that really ticked me off was when Gertrude said that I needed to be realistic, and make educated guesses considering that Camille often claims she wants to kill herself but ends up not doing so. Gertrude is basically saying, she's not going to do it.While I understand where Gertrude is coming from, I see this as an incredibly idealistic way of looking at the situation. Perhaps I am too rational, but hear me out.1) Calling suicide prevention in my country will not get her immediate help. The police respond much faster.2) The suicide prevention website in my country states that if we know someone is in immediate physical danger, we should call the police immediately. 3) The police are trained to do mental wellness checks and can respond to suicide.4) I come from a first-world country that has generally competent police.5) Trying to talk her out of it over the phone is not helpful either, because god knows what she could decide to do while we are not present. (Camille self-harms) I am not a hero.6) Of course, if Camille's parents are around to help her, I don't need to do anything because her parents know how to handle the situation. I'm talking about situations where her parents are not present/sleeping and can't help her.7) I am not interested in making assumptions about Camille's wellbeing. I am also not an expert, and I don't think I am qualified to ""assess"" the situation to determine whether I should or should not call the police. I'd rather just call and let the police experts take it from there.8) I sincerely believe that I should act on what Camille says, rather than speculate her intentions.I am very aware that the actual chance of her committing suicide is not very high. Regardless, I do not intend to be stupid. Maybe i'm fucking selfish because I don't want to feel guilty for not calling the police when I could. Please give advice because I don't know what I should do. I don't want to do anything that would be emotionally damaging. Much help would be appreciated.",1

"They say that there are no magic bullets, but I can think of one. A real bullet. All my problems, instantly solved. I never have to deal with anymore bullshit. It all just sounds so easy. I have my method all worked out, and I've tried it before. Last time my method broke, but I got something stronger this time. If you're wondering why, it's for a few reasons. I'm tired all the time, and either sleep for 2 hours or 12, never a normal amount. I am currently suspend for bad grades in my shitty college, and my bad grades are stopping me from transferring somewhere else, even if I had the energy to go back. I've spent the last 3 years of my life trying to get better, including getting on medication and seeing therapists, and they've all done jack shit. I don't have the patience for one more useless pill, pointless hospital stay, or fruitless therapy session. I've got no girlfriend which is honestly for the best since all I'd do is drag her down. My friends all left for different schools and I didn't make any permanent friends when I joined clubs. I have no one but my dad, and I can't talk to him about this. I have no energy, and can barely leave my bed most days.So, here you go guys. One last chance for the magic bullet words that make my life worth living before I end the charade I once called a life.

I'm 17 years old, male, but I'm on that side of guys who are way to sensitive for anything at all. I'm weak, short, ugly, thin, unhealthy both physically and mentally and I certainly do not feel loved or cared, or that I thus matter to anyone.

"This doesn't exactly feel like the correct subreddit for this but I figured some people here would have first hand experience. I live in California. I've been in therapy with a LCSW for a short period of time now. My suicidal ideation is sometimes discussed but I have not been open about the fact that I do have access to a gun in my home (it belongs to a family member and is unsecured thus accessible to me). This is really eating at me because suicidal ideation is something that I have struggled with over many months, even years now but with more regularity and intensity in the past half year. I know that I need help managing it. In my ideation, the gun is my method of suicide; however, I don't exactly feel suicidal currently...? In fact, I have never tried to harm myself before nor am I actively planning an attempt. But I frequently desire death, feel extremely depressed, and fantasize about killing myself. I also often fear that I could and would/will kill myself.I don't know what to do. I really want to be open about the gun and my troubling thoughts but I live with my family and am TERRIFIED of them finding out about my mental health issues and suicidal ideation. I recently came across a news article about a California man's guns being confiscated because his wife was voluntarily committed for mental illness (this occurred in 2013 though). I guess my fear is that I'll be committed too or that law enforcement will attempt to confiscate my family member's gun. In either scenario, my family would undoubtedly learn of the situation and I just so desperately want to avoid that.Do you have a similar experience? Do you know what the protocol is if a patient reveals a plan and means (being a firearm), but not necessarily active or immediate intent? What is the likelihood that law enforcement would attempt to confiscate the firearm?*might post to multiple subreddits",1

Been to councilling but it tells you things are difficult just power through them and that's it,  I mean it's good for some just not me, I've been told I will always feel like this I've just got to cope but I can't cope!

"This happened months ago, but I dated a guy for 4 months who had a lot of anger problems. We didn't bring out the best in each other. I ended up breaking up with him one day right after we had sex.I feel like a terrible person who took advantage of someone. I was so afraid to break up with him, partly because he had a temper, partly because I knew he would be crushed. I'd tried to break up with him before, but he begged and told me he was so lonely.Also, previously, an ex had a restraining order against him because he threatened her when she broke up with him. And he'd had the cops called on him for threatening someone else too. So all that was in the back of my mind.But still, nobody deserves to be broken up with right after sex. I knew I was going to end it, but I was a coward and an idiot and waited until the last minute. Kept changing my mind. He texted to me later to say he felt taken advantage of. I apologized again and again. But I still feel so guilty and abusive. I don't deserve a happy life after this. ",0
"This is an expanded repost of something I posted in the dead of night yesterday that I'm pretty sure no one read. I'm 22. My life has been an endless rollercoaster of miserable fucked up shit interrupted by periods of time where it looks like everything might turn out okay only for the rug to get yanked out from under me and the fuckery to begin anew. I can't remember most of my childhood because I was raped my a priest when I was in fourth grade. I can't really remember much of anything about my life. Even shit that happened fairly recently. I can't maintain normal relationships. First one ended in me being stalked for five years. Second one was just me being used. Third/fourth was a fucking disaster that left me completely doubting my self worth (no, it hasn't come back a year and a half later), and seriously contemplating death. This is also when my mother lost her shit culminating in a series of 5hr long screaming sessions over nothing that left me with some serious fucking anxiety. And then I got kicked out on short notice.Fifth relationship was going great until basically got kicked to the curb without warning two weeks before we were supposed to move in together. After two months of not talking I started seeing her again as a friends with benefits type thing. I kind of hate myself for it, but the alternative is being more or less completely alone because it's really hard for me to meet and approach new people. My only real long term friend got a new friend group this summer that suddenly take priority. These people also think I'm a fucking weirdo and want nothing to do with me. I don't really blame them.I got bullied a lot k-12. I understand why. I'm generally strange and aggravating to be around. I've worked on it a lot, so now people tolerate me for weeks instead of hours. After high school I took a gap year in Germany. That was a mistake. I was pretty lonely and just drank a lot. And then I started blacking out (turns out PTSD from being raped as a child can cause that), and my family basically told me I was on my own and that they didn't want to deal with me coming back at the moment (at the time the doctors were ruling out shit like brain tumors and thought I was having seizures).College sucked. I chose poorly and wasn't ready. I did a year. I'm still on leave. I know I'll never be able to afford to go back. I'm not sure that I want to. Up until Thursday I didn't think I would have to. Because this summer, after all of the bullshit, the shit jobs, the loneliness, and everything else, I managed to actually get the job I really wanted. And then I went and somehow found a way to fuck it up. Actually no, that's a lie. I know exactly how I fucked it up. By being myself.I'm not sure what's left at this point. My entire life has been about making it to the next place because that won't suck, right? Only it just seems to get more lonely and miserable no matter how hard I try. I don't have dreams for the future anymore. When people ask me where I seem myself in ten years I'm completely lost because I can't imagine even being alive in ten years. It's not that I plan on being dead, it's that I don't see how I'm going to make it. I'm just tired. I want to stop. I've been pushing for what feels like my entire life now, and I just want a break. My earliest memories are of someone stomping on my fingers on the playground while I'm trying to draw something on a piece of paper. I don't want this anymore. I have plans to keep going. I've already sent out a bunch of job applications, and am getting my documentation together for something else that may workout for me. It just hard to even draw up the energy to keep going. I feel like I'm never going to be able to sit back and relax for more than a week and enjoy the feeling that life is actually pretty okay. Because every time I finally start to get that feeling every comes crashing down like a house of cards made out of bricks.I've really tried to improve myself and unfuck my life. And to a certain extent I've succeeded. It's just not enough. I'm not sure it will ever be enough.",0
"This is going to be long, I don't know what to do or where to go. I've never felt so lost in my life and I know all the sequence of events that got me here but I was too young to control them and the adults around me too foolish to see them.I don't know what I want from writing this but I need to vent, I've cried myself to sleep the last few nights and I only want to die, I only want death's sweet embrace.If I dig deep back to my earliest memory, it's me eating a bowl of corn flakes with orange juice, there is no earlier memory, this was before pre-k (age 4). It was only when I started going to preschool that I realized something was different...Parent's talked to their kids, they hugged them, they laughed with them, they told them that they love them. It blew my 4 year old mind wide open. My parents didn't do that (my eyes are getting watery).My parents never hugged me, never told me they loved me and never gave me affection by any standard in the United States at least. I felt no love growing up and watching the people around me, it hurt.I have 3 older siblings, our age gaps range from 4-10 years. We grew up like strangers because of our parents yet we lived in the same house. My two older brothers always treated me like shit and I was the punching bag. I always got the worst of it. I never really spoke to them growing up.At school, I didn't make too many friends, I think by the time I hit first grade I was already broken. I had no one to talk to at home, my parents frequently beat me with wooden spoons, hot pans, belts (metal side too), flip flops, fists, etc. My siblings beat me...I don't remember having friends, I remember loneliness and crippling depression.In 7th grade I was introduced to public school in a new state, it was my first time going to public school. Being brown I was called a terrorist immediately and bullied. I tried to defend myself but I was scrawny and weak. I used to have so much patience at this time in my life...it was slowly erodedAt school it was just bullying and harassment. At home it was just bullying and harassment. Bullied by peers, parents and siblings I only wanted to die. I knew I wanted death for a long time at this point but I was too scared. I held a knife to myself many times but I was always too scared.I went through middle school and high school creating a facade that I was happy, that I wasn't suffering from crippling depression. Everyone believed it, including my family. Through middle school and high school I probably cried myself to sleep almost every night, I had giant bags under my eyes which I still have to this day at 24. I would pray to God on a daily basis to kill me, to end it all or help me end it all. I went to a private catholic school before 7th grade and being young and impressionable I really believe in life after death, I believe suicide will send me to hell which is somewhere I don't want to go. I suffered so much in this life already, how can I kill myself and go somewhere to suffer for eternity. I don't know what I want out of writing this but I just really want to die so badly.I felt better in college, I felt less alone but even having a gf or a few friends I still felt it...my baseline emotion at this point was crippling depression.I realized I don't know how to actually make friends, I have had so so very few friends in my life. I have no one to talk to and loneliness is killing me.No one really knows but I partially joined the military after college in hopes of finding that connection people speak of...I'm looking for that now and I realize it's just like anywhere else. I still have trouble making friends and I really don't know how to fix it. Some people I just click with, maybe like 1 out of 500 and the rest I just don't have anything to talk about, I don't know what to say. I don't want watch any sports, I don't like that stuff. I'm weird and I always try and keep that happy facade up....Lately, the loneliness and stress have just been adding up that I cant help but cry myself to sleep. I just want a friend, I just want someone to talk to, I just want to die. I pray to God that I can get into some kind of car accident where only I'll get hurt and die. I pray I can die in my sleep, I pray to have a heart attack, to get cancer, to die some sudden death or get run over. I pray that God takes the breath from my lungs.I don't love anyone on this planet, I have no desire to stay here. I have no attachments. All I've ever wanted in this life is to have my own family, someone to love that loves me back and children to raise properly. A real family, not the bullshit hand I was dealt...but it's hard.My parents let me eat like garbage growing up, we never went out to eat but all I really ate was cheese and pasta. My body never properly developed if you look closely. My head is smaller than most males as is what's between my legs, they are both closer to a childs. My body even though people think I'm muscular is soft and pudgy. I am undeveloped, my emotions are a mess, my mind is a mess. I don't know what to do with my life...I don't know why I'm writing this or what I want, I just know that if I was offered the opportunity to die, I would take it in a heartbeat. The only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fear I'll go to hell but oh my gosh...I wish someone would kill me, the loneliness and pain in my heart is so crippling, it hurts living each day. Everyday I stop caring about hell just a little bit because I want to leave this world... I want the pain to end, I want the torrent of emotions in my mind to stopedit: I think I know what I want ...I mean I want friends, I want people to talk, I want to be normal but I know that takes time.For a while I used to be good at taking my mind off these things and finding an escape but the crippling depression and desire to die has become too overwhelming it invades my every thought. I want to know how I can get out of this, I want it to stop until death can find me. Until I die, I need these thoughts to be gone, I know that's what's good for me but it's just so hard when pain and mental despair is all you know.",1

"This is my first reddit post ever. Well, I don't really know where to start. Ever since I was 13, I've wanted to kill myself. I remember the first time I seriously contemplated taking my own life. I'm second oldest of 6 kids, so it gets pretty overwhelming and chaotic at my house sometimes.  At the time, my entire family (6 people at the time, with my pregnant mom), my aunt and uncle, our babysitter/close family friend, and one of my family's friend who was my age were in a beach house together. By some miracle, I had my own room and I was laying on my bed. I was thinking about my life. The entire summer, my dad and my older brother had been picking on me. They would fuck around with me, taking my stuff and throwing it back and worth, jokingly calling me insults. They were like school bullies, but I was homeschooled so it was a constant thing. It wasn't that bad looking back on it, and I don't know why it was making me hurt so bad. So many other people go through so much more and they remain stronger than I ever am. But this continued throughout the years, getting worse by the day. My family moves around about every 4-5 months, so I can't enroll in normal school. I don't have trouble making friends, but after constantly moving and knowing I would never see my friends again made me not even try to anymore. So, I became isolated, and I was constantly bored of my life. I had no social life at all at some times and it didn't really help that I have super conservative parents, who might actually be crazy. I'm not allowed to hang out with guys (my mom told me before going off to a summer program that she would rather see me do drugs than have a boyfriend), I'm not allowed out without a thorough explanation of where I am going and what I am doing and even then they might say no, and a bunch of other crazy rules. So, naturally I spent all my free time on the internet. One summer, I saw my brother had a tinder account, and I decided to make one. I was 13 at the time, and that's a ridiculous age to be on tinder. So I start to go on it, and I'm chatting with all these random dudes. They're telling me exactly what I needed to hear. Compliments. Of course, their end goals are nudes and sex, but I was eating it up. And then I started sending nudes. I was so insecure about myself that I resorted to finding horny guys on the internet to make me feel good enough about myself. I used the app on and off for a couple years (I never met up with anybody from it), whenever I needed a quick boost of confidence. The story goes on, and throughout those few years I was a really good kid. At 14 I got into an Ivy League university and since then I've been taking classes (class of 2019!). But then I began acting out. I started to not really care about my classes (I wasn't failing at all, but not doing as good as before), and I yearned to go out and party my ass off. So when living in a strict boarding school, I completely isolated myself from everyone. I didn't have a roommate and during the day I would do whatever I had to (tennis practice and go to the school room) and then I'd go right back to my room and do whatever. My younger sister also went to that school, and we have a history. I won't go extremely in depth, but my whole life she has literally been out to get me. And while we were at the school together, she made it her #1 priority to make everyone think I was weird. She made up stories about me to them, spread rumors and a bunch of other petty stuff. But after Christmas break, I was fixated on getting lit, so I became a social person again. I told everyone I just had a super difficult last semester, but now I have an easier one so more time on my hands. I hung out with people, made friends, started to be known by people. And the first week, my new roommate brought me with her when she snuck up into the room of the two ""cool and popular"" girls of the school. We snuck out of our rooms and sprinted up, and when we got there they weren't expecting me to be there and got kinda weirded out. It was really awkward at first, but then they asked me  what was a really bad but kinda funny thing I did and I straight up said ""I 69 with a guy once, but I don't think that's really for me"" and as most high school girls would, they got a kick outta that. So we started talking more, and they realized I was actually kinda cool and funny and then they told me how my sister (we'll call her G) told them that I was so weird and this and that. But they liked me, so I was like ok cool. This ""friendship"" (it was obviously bs and fake, because these girls are the fakest people I've ever met) started to grow and then one day the most popular girl got her adderall in the mail (her mom would mail it to her every month), and she was like ""wanna try it?"". So I did, because I'd been wanting to try it . This was the first time I did drugs or anything (even drinking), but I had wanted to. I had a great first experience with it, I ended up staying up all night (dumb me took it at 9:30 at night) and I got all my homework done for the week and organized my entire room. It was great. So after that, I bought 7 pills from her to use on special occasions (midterms, finals, only when I needed it). This April (all of this is pretty recent), I got suspended from that boarding school for 2 weeks (it's pretty hard to get suspended from a boarding school, because they have to send you home and some kids lived out of the country), because I got drunk in a guy's room (we weren't allowed into the guys' rooms as girls and vice-versa). This was my most fucked up night ever. The popular girl (We will call her ""B"") forced herself onto me and kissed me, then pushed me down and I hit my head on the side of the bed (only was bleeding a tiny bit) and both of us made out with the 3 other guys there. She ends up going into the bathroom with two other guys (doing who knows what) so my drunken self was determined to keep her from getting raped or anything like that (she was sooo wasted and out of it), but I am a pretty small girl, so it was hard for me to do something when a guy who is 6'1"" is telling me he's gonna beat the shit out of me if I don't shut tf up. But I persisted, and got her out of there and kept on fighting off guys that would try to take advantage of her. Long story short, we both got back to our rooms after she threw up all over their bathroom. And then we got caught and the next day were asked all about what had happened. Well, I learned nothing from this, just that I didn't regret doing that at all and wanted to do something like that again (minus all those fucked up things). So I served my suspension, and my strict parents were so fucking mad during it. I have no idea what they were thinking, but they sent me back there. This time, with another sister in tow. I began to get into vaping and I ordered a bunch of shit online and got it delivered there. And then this kid came along and started talking about wanting a vape and I offered to get him one. I overcharged tf outta him and made some money (my parents don't give me any, so I gotta make my own) and so we started with vaping. Then we got nicotine juice, and then we moved to weed. I fell in love with weed. But with my crazy sister always around, she eventually found out through overhearing conversation and interrogating people about me, and began to spread some crazy rumors. So then, she told the head at our school and I was so close to being drug tested (I was throwing up because I was sick the day they were going to take me). I would've failed and prob be expelled. G continued to blackmail me, threatening to tell everyone. I also found out she was showing people a vid she took of me once (I have absolutely no idea how she took it) masturbating. So, she was spying on me too and recording it.I was devastated after this, and asked her why she was doing all of this to me. She thought it was all a funny joke. And I said we would be better off as friends than enemies and she said ""I don't give a fuck about you"". That hurt me the most through all of this. I cut myself for a brief period of time, and then realized it wasn't for me. So now, I smoke weed everyday, just to escape from these memories that I can't let go of. My friend commuted suicide last weekend, and it impacted me quite a bit, in that I realized the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my two closest friends. They don't even know it, but they're the reason I stick around. I want to get away from my family, but I don't know how to. I want to tell my parents that I'm suicidal all the time and that I need help, but I can't. My brother attempted to kill himself about 2 years ago my slitting his wrist (then he called the cops on himself) and when they were talking about this, they told me and my two younger siblings that he was doing it to hurt them because they were putting pressure on him to get his GED. They laughed at what he did, and kept him in the mental hospital for a couple extra days so he could ""learn his lesson"". They took his fucking shoelaces away and they laughed at him. I was speechless that they would say this, especially to their 11,12 and 14 year old kids. I'm 16 now, and I want to move out, the only way I can be happy is when I'm away with them, but they won't let me. Any tips on how to get through the next two years living with them? Sorry for the essay lol, I just don't know why I hate my life so much, because again so many people have been through so much more. I'm so grateful that I have these opportunities and I wish I could give it all to someone who has nothing, because I'm not worthy of what I have. Thanks for listening,-S",1
"This is not about me directly. A girlfriend in another country has had a family member a 19 Yo boy, the son of her sister commit suicide yesterday. 1 year ago the brother of her sister's husband also committed suicide. She herself has told me she has struggled with suicidal thoughts. The whole family is 1 day into this. How do I suggest they all get counseling without sounding like a busy body.
The complexity is we were recconnecting via email after a 7 year absence from each others lives. Making plans to visit and now this.
I don't expect her to answer my emails right now and maybe never.
I am worried about her primarily but I think the whole family may need some counseling now with 2 people in 2 years.
Her sister is a palliative care nurse so she has dealt with loss but this is much different. Her son. For my girlfriend its a bitter loss because she can not have children. Her first email to me said.""What did we do that was so bad? ''  I am miles away I knew she would say no but I had to ask if she needed me to come to be there for her. I know she will be there for her sister and the rest of the family but my selfish urge was to want to be there for her.
I am not sure what to do. I feel like everything we were planning is just over now. Its a big family for her a dozen kids dotted around the country. They will all be getting together now for the worst of all possible reasons. 19 years old and gone. We are much older in our 40's and  mid 50's but still this is going to be a very sad year or two.
Any help with an approach that is appropriate would be appreciated",1
This is not what I thought my life would be. I had a full on suicidal breakdown two days ago and instead of killing myself I called a friend for help. It was the worst decision ever and I honestly still want to die. I honestly don't know what to do anymore.,1
"This is really weirdSo, I am a 13 year old male, I'll say that now. I didn't come here for attention, nor for a bunch of people to say ""Nooo suicide is bad! Don't do it you've got so much to live for!"" I am in a very confusing situation. I've been depressed for 2 and a half years. My stepdad attacked me, I'm always negative, my mum seemed to hate me and told me she was ""f***king sick of living with me"" always swore and shouted at me constantly. Moved to my dads as a change/ fresh start. I have siblings here I get on better with than at my mums, but I'm still not that close. I've had no friends for years, I contemplate suicide daily. I just stopped cutting but its hard. I dont get pleasure from things anymore. I never have any energy or anything. My dad knows and he wants me to get counselling and anti depressants. (Suicide also runs in my family, my dad attempted, my uncle did twice and my auntie three times, as well as my cousin self harming and being really depressed for years) And so many times I've been that close to doing it. But I don't want to die- I want things to change. But it feels like they never will. I've given up. It's very confusing. I get bullied at school and told to kill myself all the time. I get that high school relationships are pointless and mean nothing, but it would be nice to not be the only one in my form to not have been asked out. Mainly because everyone hates me. Sorry, I'm rambling here, I just don't know what to do.",1

"this must be like my 5th reddit account (deleted it) but tldr, breakup (8 months ago), self esteem goes really low, and everyday I'm telling myself I'm a piece of shit. It's eating away at me.I started to lurk  and recently began to think about it again. It sounds nice to not be a burden on anyone, especially myself, any longer. But I'm scared to kill myself. Sounds like something I'd regret, and very painful.I'd hurt people around me too. Probably my mom the most. I don't want to do that. She's fought hard for me and loves me. So does my cat. Maybe my friends will care for a few months. I don't know. They'll move on eventually.I follow the advice I've read and try to tell myself positive things. I always counter it with something more negative though.I'm getting scared that if I keep my mindset like this, it's going to continue getting worse and I'm going to actually kill myself one day. I don't know who to talk to though. I feel pretty lonely, contrary to my situation. And I feel like, perhaps I'm pretending to be suicidal for attention. Maybe I'm a shit person like that. Better to just keep it bottled up than to hurt someone.I don't know. My problem's tiny compared to other people, but it feels nice to let it out on this post.",1

"Through several accounts, I've posted on SuicideWatch several times in my life. Earlier this month, I was destined to end my life. Loneliness and depression were killing me, and fast. I thought of myself as worthless and destined to fail. I was counting down the days.But I found someone.I met him. He has similar issues to me - and we realized how similar we are. How relatable we are. And we love each other. And nothing can change that. I'm so proud to say I'm alive, and finally . Thank you for motivating me to live and stay optimistic. ",1
Throughout my entire life I have been in and out of depression. A never ending cycle of feeling a little better and then wanting to jump out a window. It's exhausting. I'm physically emotionally and mentally drained all the time and I just want to be done. It's not going to get better I've been told it will and so I've hung on this long but in reality I know it won't. I'm just so tired. The thing that makes me smile the most is when I think about pulling the trigger. How it will finally all be over. No more waking up to nothing. No more insomnia. No more crying alone in the corner of my bedroom. No more disappointing anyone. No more saying the wrong thing. No more looking ugly and most importantly no more of the feeling of emptiness that can't be filled. It leaves for a little when I have a distraction but it comes back five seconds later. I HATE IT. I'm just so done. I want to die. I'm so tired of crying. I'm exhausted. It's time to go. The biggest problem though is im too afraid. I tell myself it doesn't matter I'm going to die anyway but I'm too afraid of the unknown. If I stay alive atleast I know what to expect. Pure fucking shit. But atleast shit is better than nothingness. Or maybe it isn't. That's the thing I wouldn't know if it was worse or better because the unknown. I want to go but I'm too afraid. I also currently have no access to a gun. That's the only way I'll attempt. Least chance of failure. Anyone know how to get a gun unlawfully and/or the best way to get over a fear of death?

"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.
I don't know what is wrong with me. I keep having episodes, where I go from happy and interacting with people normally to a terrible...well, I don't know what to call it. It's a very dark place in my mind. And once I go there, it feels like I am sitting in an echo chamber and every single self-destructive thought I have ever had, is being hurled at me. I will go from talking normally to people to being convinced that everybody hates me and tolerate me only because they can't say that to my face, in maybe 5 minutes. And then the suicidal thoughts will come flooding in, how I should kill myself as nobody cares about me, how my death will make everybody happy because then they won't have to deal with me. Last night was the longest such episode I have had yet. It lasted well into today morning, meaning I have been unable to do any work, which just adds onto the stress. Once before, when I had an episode like this, I talked to my big sister about it, she being one of the few people I would trust enough for something like this. I didn't tell her then that I was suicidal, though.This morning, I told her that. I told her, remember how I am down in the dumps from time to time? Well, I have suicidal thoughts to go along with them. Her response was:"" It's disgusting when people think of ending their lives for no reason at all."" I don't know why I am posting all this here, and what I am expecting to happen. All I know is, I spent last night in hell, trapped in my mind with no way out. And I have no one to talk to about it. And I am scared of when the next such episode will come along. Because last night was also the closest I came to actually jumping.Please, somebody, help me.",0
"Throwaway for obvious reasons, I don't want my few friends to know because they'll try to stop me. Probably also be posting this on subreddits that have helped me to say thanks.About 6 months ago I was dumped by the first girl I ever truly loved, before that I was getting helped for my depression and starting to feel better with her by my side. Everything is different now. Since I've gotten back to college, and back to near her, I've stopped going to counseling, stopped talking to everyone about how I'm doing and acting like I'm really happy to when I think about slicing my neck open at least every minute.I can't focus on school or friends. I'm too afraid to leave my room, my school is very small and I don't want to see her so instead I just rot away in my personal hell. The few friends I have rarely ask me to hang out or talk to me so I don't have much of a social life.Everyday all I do is think about my ex, she's the first thing I think about when I wake up and last when I go to sleep. It hurts me so much to see her so happy and doing well without me while I'm still upset about everything. I guess depression doesn't make that any better. I wonder if she even still thinks of me.I've been blowing off classes and it's only been 2 weeks, I've gone to maybe 3 classes. All I do is sit around and watch stupid videos or listen to sad music.I was told that this would all get better, that after a few months I'd be over here and that's clearly not the case. I'm so sick of feeling depressed and even when I'm not thinking of her, there is always something else to make me upset. I have nothing going for me and life just sucks right now.So yeah, after this week I will probably end my life, I'm just going to take this time to say goodbye to the people who matter to me and just so I can take a quiz, that's the last thing I need to not do.",1
"Throwaway for very obvious reasons:Hey Reddit,I don't know how to be able to word this properly or make any sense of what I'm writing but I will do my best. Long story short, I'm at my wits end and want to die. The following is going to be a LOT of verbal diahhrea so just bear with me.I have had mental issues most of my life, mostly dealing with depression. My mom wanted me to see a therapist from a very early age but my dad (prideful newfie that he was) never agreed to it. So most of my issues went unchecked and was just chalked up to just me being ""how I was"". Fast forward to two years ago and it caused me to lose my significant other, and I became homeless. We have a kid together that I haven't seen for almost a year now. I have been sleeping on couches ever since.Because of all of this, it was like Pandora's Box exploded in my head. Everything that I held in for years suddenly all came out at once. I because wreckless because I just stopped caring. I took out loans to be able to afford a place of my own (I've stayed at friends houses on their couches since), and when it seemed like things were somewhat looking up for me I lost my job. I ended up having to use the loan money to pay for myself to survive while waiting for unemployment to kick in.I have been homeless for two years, haven't seen my kid in almost a year and I miss her so much it kills me. Since my seperation my relationship with my ex isn't good. We had tension since we broke up (our relationship by the end was a fucking train wreck but that's an entire story in and of itself) and when I was able to take my daughter on weekends I had difficulty taking care of her. Like I said with my mental issues I couldn't function at all, let alone take care of a 1-2 year old. So we changed it to visits. Visits became fewer until she wanted me to sign her over because apparently me being the way I was was detrimental to my daughter so it was thought to be best that I back off. It took a month for me to make a response, and I did by email. I explained that I wanted to be part of my daughter's life and wanted to be there for her. That I was trying to get better to be the man she needs me to be. There was just too much to say by text. She never responded, I know she got the email because I've sent her emails before, and she does check that email because she has cancelled any attempt for me to send her money to help with my daughter. I can no longer afford to send money and have given up on that since every attempt to send money has resulted in it being declined and I am charged every time I try to do so.I had to go from one friend's house to another friend's house (I've been at each friend's house for a year now, and the friend I'm with now can't really deal with me being here. He's not said too much minus one email saying he is hoping I find another place to stay, but hasn't said anything since). I've given up at this point. I've been diagnosed with severe depression, type 2 bipolar, and borderline personality disorder. Meds aren't helping. I've been told before I can even start therapy I have to try to find a place to live that I cannot afford (My therapist is suggesting I try to find a place first because if I have a home of my own it would reduce my stress greatly). I've sent in an application for disability (therapist/dr's recommendation) but it could take up to three months to process. I have no money, my paltry social assistance can't help me afford a place, I can barely afford to eat. I'm also a binge/emotional eater (Being referred to an eating disorder's clinic, so eating my depression definitely doesn't help with money). I'm on a wait list for affordable housing but that can take years (I'm on an emergency list because I'm homeless, but it doesn't really help with wait time). I'm ready to give up, I can't deal with this anymore. My daughter used to be the only reason to keep going but now she's gone. My ex got a new boyfriend 3 months after breaking up with me and apparently my daughter calls him daddy now. So she might just be better off without me. I've got lamotrigine I can O/D on, there's a bridge not too far away. I'm just trying to decide between the two. before anyone says anything I've already read what a lamotrigine overdose can do. And I've read what suicide by falling/drowning can be like, but I am past the point of caring.Thanks for listening, sorry for the wall of text. There's lost of stuff I haven't included (mostly because it could be a little too specific, but there's a LOT more going on). Hopefully it wasn't too much.TLDR; My life is in shambles. Soon to be homeless, no money. Owe money, collections calling. I want to die.",1

I'm a 17 yo guy. Home sick today. I have been in a cycle of depression and happiness for the past year. For a month I'll be doing fine but then something triggers me to fall into the pit for a few weeks or a month.

Tired of this life,1
"Title pretty much says it all. ive been thinking about suicide a lot recently and different methods. the only reason i havent done it so far is becasue im too much of a pussy. On paper i have a great life. I'm at a good college on a great scholarship in my second year, and im starting to blow it. Ive been depressed for a while but im slipping especially now that my (ex) girlfriend has been slowly drifting away from me. She finally dropped the bomb on me this morning and I shouldnt even be surprised. It was long distance and lasting really well but she just cant take my depression and constant negativity and sadness anymore. I know theres more fish in the sea and blah blah but im sick of waiting. im sick of waiting to feel better. everyone was so happy for me to go to college and its been hell ever since i came here. im surrounded by friends here and i have tons of friends back home. I have a supportive family. but i dont give a fuck anymore. I commute on the train a lot and some days i want to step just 4 feet infront of me so I can instantly die. I dont look carefully when i cross the road anymore. I have access to enough drugs to overdose on. I live near plenty of tall buildings. Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, all the pills theyve given me have only exacerbated my symptoms. I dont care about leaving everything behind because life has been pain for me about the last 6 years. I've seen like 10 different therapists and my apathetic negative attitude has never changed.  Im smart but being smart doesnt mean shit. i have no work ethic or motivation for anything in life. I just picture everyone at my funeral being sad and thats one reason to stay alive.. i dont want to hurt the people  around me. but why should I  go on living my shit life just so others arent inconvenienced? Fuck college. I'm undecided major and im mentally checked out of al of my classes. i can just imagine some stupid fucking candle light vigil they would do for me to raise suicide prevention awareness or whatever. fuck this world. my brain has never stopped being paranoid, anxious, upset, and unhappy. everytime im happy i realize im just faking it and putting on a facade for everyone else. ive reached out to friends and family about how i feel and they truly do care but im too far gone to help. one of these days ill be drunk enough to finally pull the trigger. figuratively / literally .  i guess im just posting this because im too afraid to tell people the absolute truth except for a bunch of strangers on the internet",1
"Title pretty much sums it up. I'm a disgusting coward whose whole life has centered around avoiding pain and conflict. I always play things safe because I'm terrified of risk taking.I never invite people out or try to build friendships with acquaintances because I'm afraid of being shot down. I never go on social media because I can't handle the pain of seeing others have dynamic social lives. I dont exercise enough because of how much it hurts. Bottom line is I'm a fucking spineless pussy who will never get the body or social skills he wants. I have nothing to offer the world because ive run away from it for so long. I think I should kill myself in the most brutal way possible to make sure that I experience all of the pain that I was too weak to handle in life. I had a sheltered upbringing, no abuse or traumatic experiences, my parents pay for me to piss away my time at college so I dont even have financial stress. I have had a laughably easy life and yet I'm still overwhelmed and miserable. Realistically I should have died long ago. I'm 20 years old now, an adult child, and I think its too late to fundamentally change myself into a brave person who can go after what he wants. I fled from pain for my entire childhood, I want to experience true pain at least once before I die. Any ideas for a super painful method would be appreciated. Thanks.",1
"TL;DR everything is awful and I constantly want to die but I'm too scared of hurting my friends and family to kill myself for real. I've had suicidal ideations since I was a child. I think the first time I ever tried to kill myself,  albeit quite halfheartedly, I was 10 years old. I'm now 24, and I'm exhausted. Fighting it every day is so hard. I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid I will get to the point where it isn't just ideation anymore. I am afraid that my half hearted attempts of the past will become the real deal. I'm so filled with self hatred and anger. I know my family would be upset and that tears me apart to think about, but also the pain is so much to bear. I  just feel so awful all the time. Like I'm performing all my actions within a jar of molasses. It's always been like this to some extent, but lately it's gotten worseI don't know what to do. I guess I just want support. ",1
"tl;dr I hate college and I want to kill myself.I want to start off by saying that I am currently a struggling college student in my first year. I already dropped one of my classes because I was falling behind so much in that class. Now, I just want to drop out of college and give up, be homeless, and give up on my dreams of amounting to anything. It really pisses me off when people say I'm a smart person because they don't even consider the countless failures in my life and instead look at, ""oh he can solve a Rubik's cube he's a genius.""College is such a fucking scam that high schools brainwash you to get into and when you go in, they teach you all this stuff that isn't even relevant to your degree. After you become this person deeply invested in the opinions that college has, then they give you what you want. The educational system in the US is such a fucking disaster.I just want to give up and die alone on the streets, like my parents told me I would do if I didn't amount to their expectations. This massive amount of pressure has been put on me to be an A and B student in classes that have nothing to do with my degree, yet I need these classes if I want to amount to anything.This world has become so black and white and it is a miserable place to be. I wish suicide was as easy as pressing a button, but I'm too pussy to actually do anything like hang myself or jump off a building.Update: I'm just going to take a break from even stressing and recenter myself.",1

"UPDATE: Thanks for trying to help, reddit, but I don't see any reason to stay alive. Nothing has changed enough to make me want to stay. I was raped as a kid and now all I am to people is a sex object. I thought I had a lot to offer. I do slam poetry, but people here are only zeroing in on the science thing I did that was stolen. I care about people, but no one gives a damn about me. I'm just a mattress.Future grad students, know that professors can and will steal your shit. Lesbians, know that if you're not an Alex Vause look alike that you may stay single. Find someone who's worth it. Good bye, everyone.EDIT: I'm going to kill myself tonight.I'm a lesbian grad student at a conservative big name school in America. My life up until now has been shit. I'm lonely. Girls only want to use me for sex. I don't feel loved by friends. I've been struggling to find a dissertation lab. I invented something for a professor in undergrad, but now she's stealing it and giving me no credit. I want to make sure I do it the right way so that I'm gone. I'm just fucking tired of not feeling valued.",1

"Upon passing a lingerie store, Marvin realizes that his wife has never bought any lingerie in her life. He gets the idea to buy his wife something sexy to make her feel good and young.  Marvin goes into the store and tells the clerk to wrap up the most expensive, sheerest negligee she has. Marvin takes the gift and excitedly runs home to his wife. Upon finding her in the kitchen he tells her to take the gift upstairs and unwrap it. He'll wait in the kitchen. His wife thanks him and goes up to the bedroom.  Once the package is opened she realizes that this is something she's never had before. She also sees that it is so sheer it leaves nothing to the imagination. She thinks for a moment and then decides that she'll really surprise Marvin and go downstairs without any clothes on at all.  So she leaves the negligee on the bed and starts down the stairs stark naked. She calls out: ""Marvin, come out to the hallway and look."" Marvin walks out to the staircase, looks up at his wife, and exclaims: ""All that money and they didn't even iron it?!""",0

"Very brief background, and sorry for being vague on the details: I have a form of OCD that makes me scared of hurting kids. If people knew the sorts of things that went on in my head, most would think that the world would be a better place without me around. Context wouldn't make a fucking difference, it'd just be ""how can you think that? You need a bullet"" for most people.I can't help being like this; there's nothing I want more than for these thoughts to be gone. But here we are, and I feel terrible about both the thoughts themselves and how I process them pretty much constantly. The worst part is that I can't talk to anyone openly about this. For a start, I don't have time or the sufficient self-worth to actually approach a health professional, and even if I did, I couldn't actually say what was really happening without risking undue drama if what I said was misinterpreted. So I guess it's time to draw a line. I really don't want to, but I just feel like I'm out of options. I really don't want to be alive anymore when all I have to look forward to is a dramatic crash and months of crippling anxiety and self-hatred any time I have the audacity to think that I have a future.

"We moved to different countries for university. We planned on breaking up but ended up staying in touch because we missed each other. The only contact we have now is IMs and occasional phone calls.He's had bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now, but at least back then I could go to his place and hold him or if we weren't together I could, I don't know, call his parents or something.I don't know what to do now. He's currently living with some family friends, but I've never met them. I don't know his new address. Part of me is starting to think that if living is so evidently painful for him, am I even in the right to stop him?I feel like I'm doing this so wrong, trying to get him to see that his beliefs about himself are completely misguided and make no sense. But I'm deathly scared that if he doesn't have someone in his life to get him out of that cycle of thoughts, it's only going to get worse. I desperately just want him to at least try therapy.He called a psychological counselling call-line type of thing, and when he told them that he doesn't really see a purpose in his life anymore the woman told him it's just a ""teenage"" issue. I went from being thrilled that he's trying to get help, to wanting to push a call centre employee off a bridge. He, on the other hand, was more or less unfazed. He insists that therapy would never help him.His suicidal comments get more serious every time we talk about it. I feel cold sweat gathering on my back when he logs off after having a conversation.I feel selfish for constantly trying to change his mind without a true understanding of the fact that he's in legitimate pain right now. I just want him to stay alive so fucking bad.",1

"We were just 18 years old and I was a selfish and jealous boyfriend. I never laid a finger on her but the emotional pain and manipulation I inflicted upon her was clear. I was a troll, I was a person who felt underappreciated by everyone around me, and I turned these feelings into acts of provocation and a boundless sense of entitlement. Flash forward five years later, we have graduated college and we are still together. We moved across the country together. I have matured, I've gained insights about the world around me, the struggles of people less fortunate than me, and I would like to think that I have become a more empathetic person. I have realized I am not the center of the universe. The past is all behind us. she tells me that the past doesn't matter because I have changed into a better person. She thinks the early conflict of our relationship was almost a good thing, because it sparked such a significant change in my personality. She loves me, and I love her, and I don't know what I would do if I didn't have her in my life. But none of that changes the fact that I am still haunted by the things I've said and done in the past. Haunted by the person I was in the early days of our relationship, how unfathomably selfish I was, how I could say and do such vile things to the person who I love more than anything in the world. She says I need to stop punishing myself for what I've said and done in the past, because all that matters is that I am a good person going forward. but I think this is what I deserve. This pain that I am writing about is my punishment and I have finally realized it. I'm not a criminal and I'm not a violent person, but I still am unable to eat because of a fixation on the past. Why doesn't her forgiveness satisfy me? Why do I still feel worthless because of the mean things I did when I was barely a legal adult? Why hasn't the slate wiped itself clean yet!!! What do I have to do?I just know that if I were to leave this earth it would be justifiable, as I would never be able to inflict emotional trauma onto another sweet caring person. One reason that I haven't done it yet is because I know that if I were ever to commit suicide it would give her the same type of emotional trauma that haunts me almost every day, and I could never condone that type of action on the person I love most. So I guess I am now forced into a life plagued with guilt, where I will always have to live with the memories of what a jerk I used to be half a decade ago. A life where the high point of my week is embarrassing myself in front of my therapist with incoherent rambling like the kind you're reading right now. A life where I take my pills every morning with the futile hope that maybe one day I might not have to feel this way anymore ",1

"Well I don't know where to turn and have absolutely no one to talk to so i decided to subscribe to this forum, but I couldn't read one post with bursting into tears. It's like life is piling on top of me and I'm drowning and no one is trying to help. I failed out of my first year of college, which I think is the reason I'm always getting the third degree from my mom. One morning I woke up and heard her telling my siblings not to ever be like me. She'll show off all my other siblings and just forget about me. But background information, I failed out of my freshman year of college because I was getting so high I never went to class, yes this is my own fault and I absolutely blame no one but myself. I went through this horrible break up. My SO told me I was insecure, had no backbone, foolish and all sorts of things to hurt me. He left me because I'm not good for him, so my coping mechanisms were to get high and drunk. I was on a binge for weeks, missing classes, assignments, not talking to anyone, locking myself in my dorm, etc. I left college with no intentions on going back because my mental health is that bad. My mom moved to VA while I was still in school in PA. So for the summer I stayed with my aunt but we got into a big argument and she kicked me out so I had no choice but to move here with my mom. We've never had a good relationship so I already knew things would get worse. I've been battling with depression since 2013, declining medication because my first time on medicine I attempted suicide. But this year is by far my worst year with depression. I also have really bad anxiety, I have a tremor, and a rare sexual condition called vaginismus. So all these things triggers my depression. Since I've been in VA, I feel like a soul that's just levitating, watching myself sulk in pain and misery. I also feel like I'm lagging behind all my peers and people that are close in age with me. I'm currently struggling to find a job and my mom hangs that over me daily, and I can tell she's getting frustrated as the days go on but it's hard to be positive and believe in myself when she constantly puts me down and tells me I'm not capable of anything. I watch the people I've graduated high school with, enjoying life and moving forward and I can't even get pass step one. My mental health is deteriorating everyday, I can feel myself losing my mind. And recently all I've ever thought about was killing myself. I contemplate it a lot, and I just know one day it's gonna happen. And I feel like when I'm gone, it's like ive never even existed. That's how meaningless I feel in this world.",1
Well I never thought I would be here contemplating suicide. First off I'm homeless and a opiate/alcohol addict. I quit doing opiates and drinking about 1 month ago but I recently just became homeless so I moved in with my mother. My mom is a alcoholic but she was clean up until recently. I'm depressed and using opiates/alcohol to cope with the stress of being homeless since I don't know any other way to cope. I recently just found out my mother is drinking again and she used to help me with my stress but now that's she's drinking again she is never home. I feel alone and the only thing I got left to at least help me cope is opiates and alcohol so obviously I relapsed after 1 month of being clean. In a couple hour I'm gonna load up a rig so I can intentionally OD. All I want is someone to talk to in my last few hours. Sorry for the terrible wording and grammar I'm shaking really bad due to my anxiety attacks. I'm not asking for help only a friend in my last hours.,1

He gets approved, and soon enough he's meeting with the dean. The dean tells him his classes: ""Before you can get a major, we will put you in the basic classes. You know, math, logic, history, science."" ""Uh, I understand all of dose classes but that middle one. Wat kinda a class is logic?"". ""Well, let me show you.""

""I do have a yard."" says Jim. ""And since you have a yard, then you have a house, right?"" ""Yep"" ""and since you have a house, you have a family, otherwise you would have an apartment.""

"when all of a sudden the car breaks down.
The three men get out to see what the problem is only to find out the engine block cracked so they agree that they have to go find help and to meet back at the car by nightfall.
They all go to the trunk of the car to see if they have any provisions for their walk and find a jug of water and a loaf of bread. 
The first man quickly grabs the jug of water explaining to the other two that if he gets hot he'll just drink some water and keep walking until he finds help and starts to go on his way.
The second man grabs the bread and explains to his friend that if he gets hungry on his journey that he'll just eat some bread and keep walking until he finds help and leaves going a different direction.
The third man is left alone and realizes he has nothing to help him survive the desert so he unbolts the car door and starts walking into the desert in a different direction from the first two.
A hour or so later a desert soldier who was on patrol noticed the first man and asked him if he was ok. The first man explained his situation and assured the soldier that he was ok because if he got hot he could just drink his water. The soldier pointed in a direction and told him to head to his headquarters for help while he searched for the mans friends and headed out again.
A couple of hours later he found the second man still searching for help. The soldier asked him if he was ok and the second man told him he was because he had his bread to eat whenever he got hungry. The soldier explained that he found the first man and to start heading toward the car as help would soon arrive and headed out again to try and find the third man.
The soldier found the third man in no time but was confused as to why he was carrying the car door. When the soldier asked the man why he casually explained that it gets really hot in the desert and if he gets too hot he can just roll down the window to cool off.",0

"When I think about life, I just think about how fucked I was genetic wise. I could have been balding with a slightly above average dick and I would have been happy. But no, I somehow managed to be balding with a skinny ass dick at the age of 18.On top of that, I'm a virgin. I could have had oppurtunities to lose my virginity in high school but I was too much of a beta and I was scared that the girl would laugh at my dick (5.5 length and 4.2 girth). I mainly hate how skinny it is tbh.Girls used to call me cute when I was in high school but now I'm just an antisocial, unconfident fuck with a receding hairline who is barely passing his classeseven though I try to better myself (went to the gym for like 6 months and did no fap) nothing happens.
My 23 year old brother brags about his ""amazing dick"" and he is showing no signs of balding. He has a great body, gets great grades, and is going to a great school.I try to study but I just get distracted and I just don't care anymore.

I'm too scared to kill myself but I wish I had the balls to do it. I spend so much time worrying about how I look. I look at every mirror I pass by, and I really want to stop thinking about how I look but I just can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I'm that ugly, but I'm just wasted potential. I'll only look good with hair due to my weak jawline. If I had nice hair I would be so good looking, if I had a nice dick I would be so confident.

"When I was 15 years old, I had the sudden realisation that my life was pointless. I suddenly felt weak and everything that I thought was great about life was all a lie. I began to see behind the curtain and the illusion we are given that life is a wonderful thing and many opportunities await us was all lies and the world did not mean for us to be here. Before I begin to tell you the story of why today made me realise that life is nothing special, I just want to say that I'm 22 years old, I live in Manchester, England, I'm an aspiring film-maker and screenwriter. I'm about to start my final year of university and I currently work at a job that I hate. I have written many screenplays that I'm extremely passionate about, some of them are dramas, some are coming of age stories, some are comedies (because I have to make myself laugh when I'm depressed like this) and the rest are romances! I had friends in high school, I don't really see them anymore as they have moved on to much better things while I'm just sitting here, crawling through this pit known as life. I've tried changing my lifestyle many times, but I always get pulled back into pit of self-hatred and dread. I've attempted suicide four times over the last year alone, I think this is my peak and I personally think that my life is over. Most of my attempts have been done late at night when my parents and brother were asleep. I did this so they couldn't stop me from killing myself and of course, all my attempts failed! That brings us to today, a day which made me realise that life is nothing special, I've always known this, but today was the day that made me reflect that nothing is special and that we are just as messed up. I was on the bus home from work and I was stuck on there for two hours (the bus journey is usually 40 minutes) and it was packed, full of people who were late for work, college or just trying to get home. Everyone looked sad, broken and stressed! Of course, the bus was very late, but for some reason, everyone looked unhappy and life was ruined for them all. There was even a girl who looked about 16 and she had shadows under her eyes and looked like she was done with life and then there was a woman and her husband who looked like they were in their 60s and they looked like they were done with life as well. This made me think that life is just shit and we have been forced to live through it because two selfish human beings decided ""Gee let's have a kid and have them live in this shit world!"" Seeing everyone on this bus remained me that we have been brought up just to do mundane tasks and that life is pointless overall. We are just little parts of a bigger world and we have not reason to be here. All the pleasures of life have been sucked out of them including me and we have been forced to be forever stressed and live our lives in pain and misery. Everyone on this bus looked like they were done with life and it made me realise that I should finally pull the plug and end my life. At this point, I see that everyone in the world wants to end their life and I guess I should go as well. I don't really care that I'll be passing on my depression to my parents, my brother, my extended family and my friends. They will forget about me in a few months and they will move on with their lives before they die (or we decide to blow up the world for some reason) I have posted here many times here and you are probably thinking ""Just end it already, you are just seeking attention, you're an asshole!"" Well, I guess I am, I'm ready to go! My name is Jonathan, I'm 22 years old and like millions of people around the world who are ready to take their lives. I'm ready to go, I'm wish you all a very fond farewell and I hope that somehow, life gets better. I don't know how that will happen, but when it does, I want you to embrace it, whether that be your very first kiss, your first child, or even your new found happiness. Embrace it please, make this world a better place. I know I can't do that, I'm weak and inferior, but I know you can. I'm sorry to everyone who will be affected by my death, I loved you and I hope you to see you again very soon. I love you all!    ",1

"Where do I even begin... Well, I'm 14, and I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, and I've been self harming for a few years. I've felt so... Empty, lately. I guess I should talk about the main reasons of my depression, huh? For one, my brother is constantly telling me to ""kill yourself"" and ""I fucking hate you"". My sister also hates me, and she can't even tell me she loves me. I don't remember the last time either of them remotely showed affection for me. Then, my mother. She knows that I self harm and that I'm severely depressed, but she really doesn't care. Whenever I'm found self harming, she says ""you need more God in your life"" or something like that. (Me being agnostic, that doesn't help at all). Recently, she's been threatening me with ""you keep this up, I'll sent you to the mental ward"". She doesn't bother trying to help me, or anything. In fact, she's said that I have nothing to be depressed aboutLet's talk about me some, okay? Recently, I've been feeling really ugly. I look at myself in the mirror and just... Gawk at how ugly I am. I can't bring myself to stand up straight, and I don't like eating a whole lot. Not helping this, I don't get the best grades in school, no matter how hard I try, and also get bullied, and bully myself,  both physically and mentally.Now, the only thing keeping me alive is my girlfriend, who lives in Texas. I live in New York. I only live so we can have a future. She's been literally the best thing to ever happen to me, and me and her have a ton in common. We've never even seen each other's faces, but that's the problem. I'm afraid she'll repulse when she sees me, and that's why I'm scared. I'm not even living for myself anymore, I'm living for her.I don't even know what to do anymore. Idk if it's worth it, trying to put up with the agony that I call life. Please, just talk with me. That's all I want.(Update) I've been looking around this subreddit and I just feel worse about myself. My mom is right, I have nothing to be depressed over. All of these people are going through so much more, and my life isnt the best rn, and I'm whining like a little bitch over it. I'm wasting space on this planet, maybe somebody better will take my place.(Another update) I haven't been as depressed as i was originally , but I have been really lonely lately. Haven't seen my girlfriend or my friends in about a week, I'm just sitting on my ass doing nothing all day until I go to sleep and repeat that (Update 2.5) Soon after the last update, my loneliness has turned into anger.

"Will you ever get over the news  that one of your parents committed suicide? I've  thought about  it a number of times over the years but never gone through with it thinking it would be best when he got older but the more I read I see even those in their 20's - 30's struggle with a parent's suicide.  Now Son is almost twenty, but still think it's not the right time... maybe leave a note for him to be told it was an accident (car,etc). But I feel that would leave out a lot I would want to tell him via a note left from me to him at time of death. I would certainly not so it at home and run the chance of him being the one to find me.I was on antidepressants for a couple years. Discussed with doctor a couple months ago to get off of them due to  side effects with erection, and I noticed I would be crying more often, so it is not a side effect of anti depressants that I am thinking of suicide.

"with no specific end destination Andrew just walks around in a somewhat foggy state of mind. Suddenly he hears a distant and very silent cry:""Andreeeeew...""First he thinks its his own mind playing tricks with him or maybe somehow just the wind but then he hears it again..:""Andreeeew...""It sure sounds like.... could it be?.... is this?... Is this my lord, master and savior, Jesus Christ, calling my name from the cross with his maybe last breaths!? 
Still not convinced he starts moving towards Golgatha and few moments later he hears it again, this time slightly louder:""Andreeeewwwww....""By now Andrew is convinced and with no more hesitation and disbeliefs he starts running as fast as he can towards his lord. As in a panic state Andrew stumbles several times in his flip flops, falls to the ground, gets up again paying no attention to his bruises. He collide with several pedestrians and animals but he does not stop for anything.
As Andrew gets closer and closer to Golgatha the cry gets louder and louder:""Andreeeeeeeewwwwwww!""After what felt like a marathon in distance and time Andrew finally reach the top of Golgatha and throws himself in the dust by Jesuss cross. After a few moments catching his breath he looks up at Jesus and yells:""MY LORD, MY SAVIOR! I am here!"" Still breathing heavily Andrew just need an extra moment before he continues.
""Please tell me why you summoned me in this moment of pain and agony? I will do anything you demand of me, tell me what to do and I will do you bitting!""
With tears in his eyes Andrew, still on his knees and hands folded, keeps looking at Jesus waiting for his bitting. ""ANDREEEEEEEWWWWWW!!.... I can see your house from here."" Edit: English is not my 1st language.. ",0

The reason that I chose this job was because I have felt I needed to use my degree and if I don't, nothing is worth it. Throughout my college career, I have known I did not want to work with people that closely and I wanted to be research oriented. I come home from my job and something snapped in my head. I have been feeling as if the only way out is either suicide or suicide, nothing looks hopeful. My SO thinks I should try one more day, but I feel like I cannot do it and subconsciously, I've known I can't do something like this all along. I have also needed therapy for months, however, due to things that have been happening in my life since I graduated, I have not found the time to get a therapist (stupid excuse, I know). I feel as if I need to quit, get a part time job I feel comfortable and safe at, and work on seeing a therapist immediately. I am extremely worried about judgment from my SO and/or family (I won't be telling any of them any time soon). Please help me, what do I do? I feel no way out.",1

"You are such a horrible self centered person... his birthday... didnt tell him or even warn him, then get mad at him for things not going your way, then make a low key complaint about how the people you invited didnt go and you didnt even include his friends HE chose to spend his bday with... like as a wife how do you not know the people he would want to spend his day with? And again flip it on him and get mad he doesnt want the same people as you... why did all of ""his"" friends cancel on his bday when they were already available that day for him? Then on his birthday you resting bitch face him and intentionally be a sour puss on his birthday cause you didnt get your way and you dont like mma? And the worst is having the nerve to justify all your shitty behaviour by using the pms excuse.. like come on its not the 50s. You come across so spoiled and he thanked you for being bitch but letting him go thru with his own plans... fucking toxic relatiomship and he fucking loves you and puts up with it... Sorry but i just got ended 6 years of a relationship with someone i swear was you her self if not married..and me loving her and being the type to just let things go on top of you/her making everything into a giant fucking drama filled marathon where pleasing you/her is dam near impossible. Get into disagreement... i yell cause im mad cause shes yelling at me. Get told im to aggressive and hurt her feelings cause a man shouldnt yell and be able to take it. So i stopped yelling in fights and stayed silient and got told i didnt care. She kept attacking my man hood thru whole relationship and since yelling and staying silient/trying to walk away for a second to calm down is unacceptable i broke down and cried during a fight out of shear frustration since thats her goto and thought she will finally understand and got told ""you look such like a little bitch when you cry"" why cant you act like a man?"" Icing on the cake? She cheated on me with coworker who only texted her late around1-3 am when doing coke and drinking to fuck but she shouldnt tell anyone. He was embarassed people would know and she thought she was the shit. And told me its a mature relationship. Oh i went thru drug problem before this and she said me using discusted with me.. i was clean over a year, worked out regularly but yet coke head drunk fuck was hot still.. the truth was his giant dick helped her overlook most things and made her back the default position... my dick is 7 inches.. i know its only average but she literally told me it was mezmerizing and it hurt at first when apologising and asking me back cause he ignored her and wouldnt date... then a series of me taking her back followed by her cheating, leaving and fucking her friends while lying then admitting it to leave me for a week then rinse repeat... now shes the mother of my child we dont get along im a fucking masocist cause i love her to death even though she literally crippled me with mental pain and heart break and when i couldnt deal with it all and act like nothing happened or ever let it effect my opinion or trust of her she left me turned her nose up to my pain, belittles me and is now just fucking people for fun while telling me to be a better dad.i just want her back and be a family and be with my daughter but will never happen... i get her one day every 2 weeks and my biggest fear is she wont remember me or love me I actually a wrote a suicide note, got everything in order and left the house today with no intentions of going back... i actually am so confused sitting in mc ds thinking about best way to do it.. iv drug use is top of list to make it a quick rush of pleasure and end in eturnal slumber.. because why end it being sobor? So to wrap it all back up... chill out, take a step back and think about your anger and if it makes sense and know he loves you. Oh and dont leave him on his bday 2 years in a row to fuck a coworker who called her a hoe and dumb as fuck but still the magic dick power... Idk enjoy your life people. Im checking out soon. Soon as i can man the fuck up and not be such a bitch. Tl;dr loved someone with asburgers(sic?) Who i swear never was caught cause shes a female and pretty sure my life is ruined and will only be misery and me mot being able to mentally take it all and function as an adult now , i also will ruin my daughter by being a shitty dad adding to my depression and final conclusion to just step aside and let life game over and see whats next.
